A drastic improvement in my french fluency skills, especially a new comfort with the language that allowed me to communicate with french people. In this way I made many valuable connections with various people who live in Paris. I also learned how to live in a large city and independantly. 	I wish I had planned more visits to the surrounding countries when I had free weekends. I also wish I had scheduled more cultural visits on my own before my schedule filled up. 	I saw how different the education systems are in the two countries - mainly that that university students don't take classes themselves that seriously (they don't always show up, they speak while the teacher is speaking, etc) but those who are motivated do a lot of independant studying. Thus learning happens a lot more on one's own, less from the teacher and class discussions. But I saw that many french students are very motivated, and in this way those who wish to learn will take their education into their own hands without being babied. 	I enjoyed meeting and making connections with french students, who always helped me and made going to class very enjoyable. 	70-80%	Speaking	I tried to speak French constantly, without fear of being wrong or sounding stupid. In this way everyone became my french teacher and I learned many new words, correct grammar, etc. 	Often	Rarely	Rarely	Sometimes	Sometimes	Very helpful	Helpful	Helpful	Very helpful	Helpful		Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		Yes	Yes	I enjoyed the Ballet, for normally for budget reasons I would probably not have bought tickets. I also really enjoyed the cheese tasting and lunches, for I felt that I got to try things that I would never have bought or ordered on my own. 	No		Yes, I joined an orchestra which really helped me meet some wonderful people, and gave us something automatic in common. 	Yes	Group	Academie de la Musique																No		The language classes and organized trips  - in this way I got closer with the people on the VWPP Program before going to an unknown large city. It was good to be in a small french city before going to Paris to help improve comfort with the language and culture. 	Though my host was very nice, towards the end I found the situation very stressful because she seemed very unhappy with me but did not communicate why. However, I really enojyed all of the excursions! They gave us a wonderful chance to see a beautiful part of France and frnech culture.  	No. 	Be prepared to SPEAK FRENCH no matter what level you are, and don't be afrid to make mistakes, because the point is to improve the language. Though it is nice to get close to others on the program, try to explore other friendships and activites with french people, and don't limit yourself to always going out with other American students. In this way you will make meaningful connections, better understand French culture, and of course improve your french! Keep an open mind and know that France is very different from the safe bubble of American Universities. Also be prepared to feel isolated at times, because there is not campus feel - though your world gets wider with more opportunities, it also gets smaller as the number of people you know diminishes drastically.

An increased French-speaking ability and a significantly deepened understanding of French society, culture, and political issues.	I should have spent less time with American students.	Besides learning a fair amount about the system itself (organization, grading, etc.), I had a fantastic introduction to French "bureaucracy".	CM lectures helped me quite a bit in understanding spoken French at a "normal" speed and helped me meet several ERASMUS students.	Less than 50%	Writing	Having more intensive writing assignments in French than ever before, reading much more than I am used to, and receiving regular feedback on my writing all contributed to improved grammar and active vocabulary for me. My reading capabilities improved somewhat, though my inactive vocabulary was already fairly large upon arrival. Speaking has improved significantly, but I tend to use simpler grammatical constructions, etc., when speaking than when writing, due to the speed of conversations. Comprehension has improved across the board, but I feel this is largely as a result of hearing people speak much more often rather than reading, etc.	Often	Rarely	Rarely	Sometimes	Rarely	Very helpful	Not applicable	Not applicable	Very helpful	Helpful		Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	I found the cheese tasting the most enjoyable, both because the event itself was highly enjoyable - and the cheese was delicious! - and because I was translating, which I found incredibly helpful with my French skills.	No		Yes; I simply started conversations from time to time. They always seemed surprised but were not hostile - often quite friendly, especially in bars or on campus - and this led to making one friend with whom I take lunch weekly.	No																		No		It was helpful to be eased into French culture in a less hostile environment than Paris.	My housing experience was quite nice, with fantastic food. Cultural activities - trips, etc. - were all engaging and provided excellent learning opportunities.	The special classes focusing on university skills were, while somewhat necessary, very poorly conducted and not nearly as helpful as frustrating. I find it hard to be more specific, but as an example, one of the classes dealt intensively with "taking notes" and involved a large amount of shorthand (intended so that we could read other students' notes, I think?) which proved both stressful at the time and 100% useless in the long run, at least in my experience. I believe it was also useless for my friends in the program.	Avoid hanging out at Reid Hall; separate yourself as much as possible from students on the program, as it will be nearly impossible to immerse yourself in French speaking experiences if your friends are American. At the end of the program, you will regret forcing yourself to find sometimes hard-to-make friends much more than you would regret only befriending Americans.	I am surprised and disappointed that there is little or no effort given to connecting students in the VWPP with ERASMUS students. While ERASMUS students are not necessarily the most dedicated, they are much more open than French students and provide a fantastic source for American students to learn about European cultures, "broaden their horizons", make lifelong friends, and converse with students who often speak French better than English.

My french definitely improved, especially my listening comprehension. I got to experience living in a different culture, as well as living in a large city for the first time in my life. Having access to all the wonderful cultural institutions in Paris was wonderful, all the museums and music everything that is unique here.	I would have tried to make an effort to meet more french students. Also, a lot of the churches and museums I visited I visited by myself. I would have tried to do more things with other people from the program.	I learned that I hands down prefer the American system. The french system is a lot more hands off, "figure it out for yourself", in a way. In my Paris 4 class I essentially felt anonymous in a way that I really didn't like.	It forced me to work hard. Also, I really liked the subject matter of my course and I've found the lectures interesting, so I've been motivated to go to each course meeting.	More than 80%	Comprehension	Living with a host family, especially a family with kids. The kids talk a mile a minute and don't slow down, so I sort of had to learn to keep up.

It was interesting to compare the Opera Garnier and the Opera Bastille. The excursions outside of Paris, particularly to Giverny/Rouen were wonderful.	No		Not really.	No																		Yes		Living in a host family and having dinner there each night was great to practice speaking french. The course at the Alliance was also helpful, and the afternoon activities were also interesting.	My housing was great; it was especially nice because there were three other Alliance students there, as well. I loved the trip to Saint Emillion. The Musee Aquitaine was interesting, but the visit felt a bit overlong.  	I loved it and thought it was very well put together. It might have been nice to have an organized meeting the sunday following our arrival, however.	Really go out of your way to read in French or watch French news or movies before arriving. Try not to be too tethered to the US with the internet. Also try to meet other french students as much as possible.	I'd suggest talking up buying a SNCF 'carte jeune' during orientation for anyone planning on taking more than just one or two train trips in France. 	
Ability to understand French and a different culture. Independence. 	I might have tried to get an internship. 	It is incredibly frustrating. People (students, professors, administration) are not very welcoming or willing to help. 	To be honest, I did not enjoy my classes at the French university and I don't think I got much more out of them than I got out of my Reid Hall courses. I enjoyed seeing French students our age, but I had no interactions with them. 		Comprehension	Hearing French so much definitely helped me to understand it. I was forced to make myself understand what was being said to me and the language being spoken at a much faster rate. 	Often	Rarely	Never	Often	Never	Helpful	Helpful	Not applicable	Not helpful	Not applicable	At the beginning of the semester, we really struggled with getting our French university classes. I don't know whether we were told to sign up for classes at the wrong time or the university told the program the wrong time, but either way we couldn't sign up for classes for a long time and missed the first week of classes. It is hard enough to go to a foreign speaking university, so it added a lot of stress not to be there for first week. Additionally, as a result, we had to take whatever classes we could find and therefore we did not take the classes that we wanted to take. Maybe I would have enjoyed my university classes more if I had been interested in the content. I would really have appreciated more guidance in that difficult and stressful process. 	Yes	No	No	No	Yes	No	No	Yes	I really enjoyed the ballet, but I think that's because I've always loved dance and ballet. I think it was great that the program offered trips outside of Paris. I loved Vaux le Vicomte etc. 	No		I met some French people through my host brother, but overall I found it incredibily difficult to meet young French people. 	No																		No		It was interesting to see a different part of France. 	Although I could not imagine living with my host mother in Bordeaux for the entire semester, I really enjoyed being with her for the first two weeks. She was never able to have children and she was divorced, so she was completely and fully invested in her host students. She seemed to really enjoy having us and teaching us about French culture. She took the time to speak with us in French, correct our French (in an encouraging way),, and she encouraged us to try to explain ourselves in French no matter how long it took. 	It was very tiring having classes all day and then planned activities after classes and on the weekends. I would have liked a little more free time. 	I don't think I could have really prepared differently or could tell someone how to prepare, but I think people should expect to feel lonely and isolated  - of course there are great parts of studying abroad in Paris too, but I feel like this was never really said to me and it would have perhaps been helpful to expect it. When talking to other Wes students before going abroad, they all told me that going abroad was the most incredible time of their college experience. However, since being here and talking to these same students, they now confess that they had a very difficult time and were incredibly lonely. It's not to say that people should say this in order to discourage you from going abroad, but I think it could maybe make the semester easier if you can expect it and know that it is normal. 		
I spent some quality time with people I didn't know very well from Wesleyan and people I didn't know at all from Vassar. The whole experience of being thrown into a foreign place was a great way to bond with my fellow program members, and thus to be exposed to new ideas and ways of thinking.  In that same vein, being in a foreign country made me think about things differently -- it's hard to describe exactly how, but I feel as if it gave me a new perspective on my academic career.  And as a bonus, I think my French got better, too!	I would have gone to more museums / done more cultural activities.	I really disliked the French university system in that it was terribly frustrating on many levels.  The inscription process was entrenched in bureaucracy and was one of the least user-friendly processes I have ever participated in.  In addition, the teaching style seems based on criticism and mistrust of students; the paper grading system, for example, seemed extremely unjust, and the professor's notes were often jeering and snide, which I found totally inappropriate.  Finally, I don't feel as if I learned much (if anything) with regard to the subject matter in either of my university classes.	It was an exercise in patience.	50-70%	Writing	The Reid Hall classes were fantastic for my writing skills, especially Ecriture de Soi.

Housing was good -- I liked living with another student (Tess) as it made interacting with our host parent less awkward.  To be honest, I don't remember many of the cultural activities except for a walking tour (during which I was extremely dehydrated and faint) which seemed to go on forever.		I would say that it's hard to prepare because it's going to be such a new experience whichever way you slice it.  Practice your French, though.		
My French improved a lot, and I loved living with a host family because I feel like my understanding of French culture has grown immensely. I also really appreciated the benefits of Reid Hall - a quiet place to study, and to work with other VWPP students who were facing the same challenges as me.	I wish I had spoken French more with the other VWPP students, like the Middlebury students are obligated to do.	I learned a lot about how French students interact with their teachers, how they interact with each other, and how differently French universities treat their students from American universities.	I learned how to pick out the important information from a lecture, which can be really difficult in a foreign language. 	50-70%	Speaking	My host family and my Reid Hall classes - my Paris 7 class doesn't have a lot of opportunities for discussion, but my Reid Hall teachers really pushed me to speak in class.

No																		Yes	Terra Foundation for American Art	I appreciated the grammar classes in Bordeaux - they were really helpful, but our free time was the most useful to me, because I had to learn how to get around and visit Bordeaux all in French. It prepared me for getting around Paris on my own.	I really liked the cultural activities in Bordeaux, but I felt like the housing could have been better screened by the VWPP instead of just assigned randomly by the Alliance.	I didn't feel like I gained much from the ateliers at the Alliance that we had in the afternoons.	Listen to French music, watch French movies, and read in French before coming to acclimate yourself a little before you arrive.		
I think my semester in Paris was beneficial in many ways, a lot of which exceeded pure academic benefits. I think the obvious benefits such as the improvement of my language skills and my increased knowledge of the French culture, were supplemented by learning to be a more independent person who could adapt more readily to foreign [and somewhat scary!] environments! 	I think I would have been more adventurous and less shy in retrospect, and probably tried to befriend more French people. 	The French University system was a very interesting learning experience for me, especially coming from a small liberal arts college. Taking classes at the University highlighted the differences between the American and French education systems, which was really interesting from a cultural standpoint. 	My attention span had to learn to endure 3 hour long courses which is beneficial. 	50-70%	Comprehension	I honestly think the improvements just come from repetition and exposure. My comprehension has improved from learning more colloquial ways of speaking French rather than just rigid, textbook French, which has been very helpful for me.

I really enjoyed the cultural activities and found Bordeaux to be a really lovely place! 	My housing in Bordeaux was great, my family made me feel very welcome and comfortable and made great food! The cultural activities were fun, if a bit numerous and long at times. I think a little less structure could be good in the first two weeks, as I remember wanting to explore a little independently. 	I believe more free time instead of constant, program sponsored, structured outings would be beneficial. 	The major things I learned that I hadn't considered before: It's more expensive than you think, you DO get homesick, and it does get very cold. Those were three things I vastly underestimated. 		
Living in Paris beyond anything granted me the opportunity to take advantage of the art/theater/opera here in France.  Constantly going to museums, parks, etc. was a beautiful and enlightening experience.	I would have chosen a different university to attend classes at, one with a stronger art history program.	The grading system here is radically different and discussing it with French students was astonishing in that many aimed for the "moyen" or the middle.  	Being immersed totally with French students and a French professor for 3 hours provided 3 hours of solely French being spoken (personally much more beneficial than a 30 minute tutorat).	50-70%	Writing	Being able to read and listen constantly in French made me more aware of how to form sentences and avoid direct english translations.

No																		No		The orientation itself I found to be most helpful in that the 2 week program allowed for a grace period of organization and climatisation to the French environment ie cellphones, notebooks, etc.	The housing was great in Bordeaux! The room was immense and I had free reign in the kitchen whenever I pleased.  The walking tour around Bordeaux and the wine tasting were the most memorable activities for me.		I would definitely recommend making a list of places outside of Paris you want to visit most and really reflect on them because the time goes by incredibly fast and it is easy to get caught up in daily life of Paris without leaving.		
My language abilities have improved drastically, I made wonderful connections in Paris (particularly with my host mother), and I really got to know this beautiful city.	No, there is nothing I would have done differently. 	The American and French classrooms function quite differently. The grading system is different, the relationships between students and professors are different, and the type of work is different. I prefer the setup in the United States, but I appreciated being able to experience something completely different (huge seminars, grading out of 20 points, etc.)	The most positive aspect of taking courses at the University was definitely related to the language. Even though it was frustrating in the beginning, my courses at the university definitely gave me more confidence in my french abilities and I think that helped me a lot this semester. 	70-80%	Comprehension	The time I spent in my apartment or with my host mother probably helped me the most with my comprehension, and the time I spent in class or doing work helped me the most with my reading and writing.

Yes	Club	Choir at Reid Hall																Yes		Bordeaux was the reason that I had friends already made before I came to Paris. The language classes were good (although I think I was in a level that was one or two below where I should have been) as a refresher and a reminder before coming to Paris. 	I absolutely loved my host mother in Bordeaux. The cultural activities were great, I loved the walks and museum visits, but were also at times exhausting (especially with the early wake up call for the language classes). 	Making all of the same activities available but also optional would probably be my only suggestion.	I was absolutely terrified to come abroad. I thought I wasn't prepared language-wise, socially, or mentally, and the first few days were very difficult for me. But after those days, things get much easier. My advice for people who are feeling how I felt would be to put yourself out there and trust that you will be more than fine with your french abilities as long as you continue to try. Take advantage of the opportunities that you have here, too, because four months seems like a long time in theory but it goes faster than you can possibly imagine. 		
Definitely my french, being forced to use it in a daily context and forcing myself to think in another language. But also I have been really lucky through my classes and interactions with my host family to learn a lot about French culture and parisian life, much more than I did before. i feel like I know so much more about the history of the country and city, as well as the social and political issues of France that I had not considered before and make my understanding of international politics much richer. 	I wish I would have spent more time with my host family, it took me awhile to feel comfortable/learn how to act in the apartment and since they have many young children it was hard for me to integrate myself without spending 100% of my time there, like the rest of the kids do, so I felt a little out of place sometimes even though they are really interesting and open.	It was almost shocking at first to see the contrast in the teaching/evaluation methods in France versus the US but it was a really interesting challenge to have to structure my work and thinking in a different way this semester. It is hard to not have a relationship with your professor or any other students in the class, and the format of just arriving in a room to listen and take notes for 2 hours is definitely tough but it I'm glad I had the experience and learned a new approach to studying.	Both of my courses at Paris IV were history courses, and its amazing how thorough they were, so I ended up with a lot more knowledge of those subjects than I had before. I think the reason they are able to cover so much material is because its a lot of just memorizing facts and dates and not really any discussion but I appreciated the opportunity to formulate the analysis on my own without any prompting from the professor.	70-80%	Writing	The editing process at reid hall was really helpful, in terms of feedback on papers etc. The fact that I was constantly writing and editing made me really focus on context and syntax and I feel a lot more comfortable with grammar now.	Sometimes	Sometimes	Never	Sometimes	Never	Not helpful	Not applicable	Not applicable	Not helpful	Not applicable	I had a really difficult time enrolling in my French university courses and I feel like the program could have been a lot more helpful with it. I really had no idea what I was doing or where to go, or even the time frame for registration so it was really stressful. I didn't even know what to do when I got to the university so it was really hard to communicate with the registrar what I needed since I had no information from the program to give them about my academic status/enrollment. I ended up in L1's which was totally not my intention but it happened because I was confused about the 4 different sites of Paris IV and the many offices and enrollment periods for every different level and concentration and at first I was really upset about it. I wish I had had the opportunity to take a course in a department outside of history at Paris IV as well but the enrollments for every department were at different locations and the registrar at the history department was very confused when I told him I was on a program that allowed me to take whatever I wanted, mostly because he had never heard of VWPP and I had no real direction or information to give him. In the end I am happy with what I learned but I felt really like I had no other choice but to take the exact two classes that I was enrolled in.	Yes	Yes	Yes		Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	The ballet was really beautiful. The whole experience of going to the opera, which is a great building in itself, as well as being able to see a performance like that was unforgettable. I really appreciated that the program gave us the opportunities to experience the theater and art scene in paris like that.	No	n/a	I did not.	No																		No		The classes at alliance francaise were really helpful to me just because I got to focus and go over some basic grammar in a classroom setting before being forced to sort of "hit the ground running" with my french every day. I liked the style of the classes and the fact that we got to meet other international french students.	My housing was great and a really well chosen spot for a student. The cultural activities in Bordeaux were really fun and and a great start to the semester, I loved going on the excursions and feeling like I was getting to see a little bit more of France that way.	no	Do as much research on the universities as possible, and the program should help facilitate looking at course listings etc even before the students go abroad. Also I think a lot more preparation should be done for living with a host family.		
The main benefits I derived from France: 1)great improvement in my French language skills 2) knowledge of an interesting new culture 3) new friends and acquaintances of all kinds 		I learned that the French university is more strict in terms of what is expected from your essay writing format. You are also not given as many guidelines such as exact readings and assignments and are often expected to do much on your own outside of one or two big assignments. 	Taking a course at the French university was good for me because it got me out of my comfort zone. I was scared taking classes at a completely different university but I got more comfortable gradually. I think this was a valuable experience because it forced me to adapt to a new environment, and a new style of classes. 	50-70%	Comprehension	Constantly being surrounded by French has drastically improved my comprehension. I find myself more confident in writing as well and have certainly improved in speaking though not as much. 	Sometimes	Often	Sometimes	Sometimes	Sometimes	Helpful	Helpful	Helpful	Helpful	Helpful		Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	The most rewarding experiences were the trips outside of Paris because it was really fun to get out of the city and see sights around the area. I especially enjoyed the trip to the Cyclopse sculpture/museum and the Vaux le Vicomte. I really wished there was a trip to Normandie and the D-day beaches, which I would find extremely interesting and enjoyable. I unfortunately didn't get a chance to go there by myself. 	Yes	I really enjoyed the tours around Paris with the IPAG students in the beginning of the semester. They were a great way to get to know the city and get to know some students our age. I had a lot of fun taking silly photos and walking around places I hadn't at that point seen before. 	I joined a lacrosse team. It was made up of people mostly from Britain and America but there were some French people and it was interesting to meet them and see them playing lacrosse, a sport little-playef in Europe. 	Yes	Team	Paris Lacrosse 		ladies@paris-lacrosse.fr														Yes	I was an English assistant at IPAG. I really enjoyed it because it gave me a chance to meet students my age and also gave me experience working with others on their English language skills. The classes were about building resumes and applying for jobs which as a student myself I also found useful. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming and I'm happy I did it! 	I liked easing into the program in a smaller city and I found it easier to take part in Orientation activities in this kind of environment. I thought the French classes were good for refreshing our language skills before leaving for Paris. 	I really enjoyed the trip to the Dune de Pyla. It was beautiful by the ocean, and I was happy we got time to walk around and explore on our own. I preferred these types of activities outside to wine tastings and other indoor activities. 	I preferred outdoor activities like the trip to the dune de pyla to wine tastings and other indoor activities. If it would be possible I would suggest more of these types of activities, outside, with time to explore on your own. I think maybe one wine tasting would have been enough for me, though I did enjoy the trip to the chateau. 	I would suggest practicing and reading in French as much as you can before getting here. Perhaps taking a review course in the summer before leaving. 	I just wanted to add a note about Bikram Yoga. In the future I think students should be told that signing up for  Yoga means they are signing up for 15 classes and taking out 150 euros out of their reimbursement money. If future students do want to sign up, they should maybe also be advised to sign up for fewer classes since 15 is a lot and I don't think anyone that originally signed up used nearly that many. I know I was signed up for 15 after going once and ended up only going for 6 sessions. In retrospect I wish I had used that 150 euros for something else. Otherwise I was completely happy with the reimbursement system and found great ways to use it! 	
Getting to know a more Parisian way of life and meeting some great friends from Wesleyan I otherwise wouldn't have met.	Even though I'm glad I met great friends on the program, I really would have tried harder to separate myself from my fellow Americans in the program to try and meet more young French people; I felt that I didn't have nearly enough exposure to actual French young people, or even other people with whom it would feel more natural to speak French (like other foreign students - that's what I enjoyed about classes at the Alliance in Bordeaux; we spoke French to each other because everyone wanted to and it was the best language in which we could communicate).    There's a general sentiment here and even among other foreign students outside the program I've talked to about this that it's hard to make friends with young French people (at least in Paris), that they aren't really interested in us.	Time management is really important.  If you don't start preparing for les devoirs finals well in advance, the last two weeks are like Armageddon.	I felt that was where my French improved the most - through speaking during discussions and through listening to others.	Less than 50%	Comprehension	Time in class at the French university.

Come into it with the mindset that you are going to put yourself out of your comfort zone and meet people outside the program (whether foreign or French) who are willing to speak French with you; that's how I would have approached this semester if I'd had the foresight.

Greater knowledge of French culture and language and greater knowledge of myself through strenuous experiences.	I would have tried to take smaller classes at Paris 4, or applied to a different French university if that wasn't possible.	I do not enjoy the style of the French university.  I feel that the professors are not helpful and feel that it is the students duty to understand and not the professor's duty to explain.

There were a lot of activities and it would have been nice to have some more time to explore a city other than Paris without the help of the program.		I would advise students to try to take small classes at their French university because I imagine it would help them to meet French youth.

my french improved greatly, i loved the city and got to eat delicious food and travel to other parts of europe i otherwise would not have been able to afford to visit	i would have exercised my calf muscles in anticipation of my stairs, and maybe not have chosen to be a vegetarian as a child since it made eating here more difficult. also, i would have done more things to use my 350 reimbursement euros 	The excepted/accepted style of writing is very different, and generally classes are not discussion based.

It was then very difficult to find classes I could take that would count towards my major at Wesleyan, as we had been told it was taken care of when it had, in fact, not, meaning that we were still trying to get into classes two weeks into the semester. Overall, the program was nice and helpful with most matters, but as far as signing up for classes at Sorbonne 3, it was very stressful and I did not feel like the program had done the best possible job of helping us find classes. 	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	I really enjoyed the trip to Giverny; the lunches and dinner on the boat were also very pleasant. It's great that the program works hard to find fun and interesting activities students can participate in. 	No		I was in a somewhat special position as I lived with a french roommate; I spent time with her and her friends somewhat frequently. I also made friends with another student in one of my Sorbonne classes and got lunch with her occasionally after class. 	No																		No		I really, really enjoyed the time in Bordeaux; I think it is a great opportunity to get to know and bond with the other students on the program before we were all divided up into different parts of Paris. The time in Bordeaux was relaxed, but full of fun things to do, and the city is adorable. 	I've already commented on my housing in Bordeaux in my housing evaluation, but will copy & paste that paragraph here for convenience. I believe Chloe, who lived with me in Bordeaux, and my parents have  both already contacted someone in the program or at Wesleyan about  this, but my host family in Bordeaux was incredibly irresponsible  and inappropriate, and I would recommend they be barred from  any future programs. They went out to a party until about 2 am,  entrusted Chloe and I to care for their severely disabled adult son,  without asking or even informing us. Luckily, I have experience working with handicapped and special needs people, and was able to deal with the situation as best as possible. However, Chloe was incredibly distraught and had I not been there, I would have been very worried for both her safety and comfort, in addition to that of the host son. In short, he tried to climb out of a second story window, fell in the shower, soiled his bed, and when I called the host parents repeatedly about this asking them to please come home, they laughed and told me he acted out for attention. Obviously, I  found this very disturbing, and I do not think they are fit to house students again. Again, this is only in respect to my housing in Bordeaux, my housing in Paris was great.	Don't let the Alliance Francais put anyone else with the family I stayed with. Other than that, not really, I thought it was great. 	They should be sure to practice French in the weeks/months before their departure, and be fully prepared to immerse themselves in the language, as well as the culture. They should be ready to be more on their own than likely they have been previously, and get excited about living in such a great city!		
I feel as though I came very close to achieving fluency in my French speaking and comprehension, and my reading and writing skills also both improved tremendously. I also was able to experience a different education system, but had the good fortune to have chosen classes that had some similarities to my American liberal arts education. Culturally, there are too many benefits to list. I was simply astounded by the amount and density of cultural and artistic capital in Paris, and plan to come back as soon as possible, both to continue practicing my French and exploring this wonderful city.	I would have liked to travel a bit more, both inside France and to other European cities. In particular, I wish I had better taken advantage of the Toussaint break to travel rather than staying in Paris, although it was still a very useful break from classes. 	That the university seems to be seen exclusively as a place to attend classes rather than a center for social life, and that French students are often more reticent when it comes to oral expression and critical analysis than American students. However, my prior misconception of all French professors as strict and distant was entirely proven wrong, and the classes I was in featured much more student participation than I had expected.	Seeing how French students took notes, gave oral presentations, and prepared for major projects was very helpful for me, both for learning differences between the French and American systems and for figuring out what would be expected of me for said aspects of my coursework. 	50-70%	Speaking	Living with a host family and taking classes in French that all included, to varying degrees, a spoken component.

No		Yes. I tried to go to bars and music events without an excessive American presence, and often did meet young French people, although I found it difficult to forge lasting connections. 	No																		No		As somebody who had never been to France before, I was glad to spend two weeks in a mid-sized city with many international students rather than being thrust directly into Paris' bustling urban environment. This more gradual acclimatization very much helped me get used to being in a foreign country. Also, the language classes were very useful for getting my French back up to speed, as I had gotten rather out of practice over the summer.	My housing situation worked out perfectly, as I was directly at the center of the city and appreciated being able to walk everywhere. I realize that I was the lone exception and that most other students had either long walking commutes or needed to take the bus and tram, but I nevertheless found the transportation to be easy to negotiate and Bordeaux to be an extremely walkable city. The cultural activities were all very educational and fun and I appreciated the exposure to another important city and region of France before leaving for Paris. 	No. I found the session to be ideal for getting used to life with a host family and in a French city, and the scheduling was appropriately busy for helping negotiate culture shock and homesickness. 	I would encourage them to speak to as many previous VWPP students as possible to find out about what university courses are like (in general and for specific courses), and to ask questions about living in Paris.

1. A solidifying, capstone experience for my French language skills.  2. A great perspective on a country whose culture has so influenced my own.   3. An opportunity to meet some great people French people as well as plenty of Francophiles.  4. Paris was a great launching point to visit so many other locations in France and elsewhere.  	I would have tried to expand my "stage" with the elementary school into a credit earning course and would have then dropped the L2 class. The TD teacher of the L*2* class was borderline ridiculous in his grading, and I definitely did not get the returns on the significant investment of time and energy that I put into that course. Had I known that the grading was going to be so harsh, I would have spent the time doing more socializing and experiencing Parisian/French life. That academic part of my experience was exceptionally disappointing. 	1. The disorganization.  (Along with an academic calendar that seemed at one point to change by the hour, they attempted a campus switch during the semester   2. The lack of care and effort that the average french student puts into their coursework.  3. The lack of a safety net for those students who weren't motivated/preformed poorly. 	1. It made me incredibly thankful for being able to attend Vassar.

Also, watching her on national cooking show later on in the semester was pretty cool.	Keep up the great job!	Be open, be as out-going as possible, abandon your Vassar/Wesleyan expectations of grades, plan to travel as much as possible.	Thanks for what was overall a fantastic semester experience. I've dreamed of living in France since I was a little, and for me this was an experience of a lifetime. The VWPP program and staff were key to this.    Oh, and Lisa, that was an excellent way to experience the election. :-D	Ian Edwards
The benefits have been innumerable, but I would say the most important is my language skill level.  I feel as though I have improved more in Paris than I have in every year of French I've ever taken.  I can now comprehend fluently, and speak nearly fluently.  The other benefits have been social and cultural.  I've been able to travel and just experience living in a European country on my own, and it has made me more out-going, ambitious, and confident.  Not to mention all the wonderful people I have met along the way, who have molded this experience for me and had a huge impact on my well-being in PAris.	I would have gone on more excursions and explored more.  The most wonderful days I've had were when I ended up somewhere I had never seen before and explored.  I didn't take to heart how short this semester would be.	I learned that it is very different from the American system, in both positive and negative ways.  It was a little difficult to acclimate, but it has expanded my experience with education.	The most positive aspect was getting to see a part of French culture that most travelers can't.  By experiencing the French system, I could better understand French students I met and bette relate to them.	70-80%	Speaking	Speaking with my host family, friends, and strangers.

No															6 Cameron Court		Charlotte Andrews	No		I thought the Bordeaux orientation was a great way to ease the students into French culture.  It was beautiful and big enough to be exciting, but small enough to be manageable.  I found the group excursions to be particularly rewarding, such as the Dune du Pyla.  	The only negative thing about my housing in Bordeaux was how far it was from the centre-ville.  I had to take a bus from an area that was potentially dangerous at night, and had to take the same bus to get anywhere in town.  I thought the cultural activities were fantastic, especially the cooking course.	I was very happy with the orientation, but perhaps I would recommend more organized events with the program.	I would advise students to be open minded and try everything, to not be afraid of meeting new people, and to not hesitate to go out and explore on your own.  I made the most incredible discoveries on walks along the Seine or through Montmartre, and those are the memories that really defined Paris as a city for me.		Charlotte Andrews

I see the main benefits that I derived from this semester as being my progress in French, the relationship that I developed with my host mom, the free time that I had to go to exhibitions and to explore the city, and the experience of going to a larger public university and of getting to know some French students in my smaller university class.	In retrospect I would have pursued friendships with French students in my class earlier on and more aggressively.  It can be easy to feel awkward and as though you're trying to force relationships, but by the time I actually started asking people to do things outside of class I realized that they were totally willing and probably would have been willing much earlier on.  I also would have started an extracurricular activity (in my case, dance classes), earlier on in the semester. At the beginning it's very exciting to have so much free time to be out in the city, but by the end I was wishing that I had added some additional structure to my schedule earlier on.  I also realized that I had no reason to be intimidated about participating in French culture in this way.	I learned that the French university system is extremely lecture based and puts very little emphasis on discussion, but once you adjust to this difference it can be very rewarding to try to profit from the professor's expertise.  I also learned that French professors can be extremely particular about details--I was penalized on one of my essays for not skipping a line between my intro, my body and my conclusion, for instance--so it's helpful to try and clarify all these specifics when assignments are first given to you.	Meeting other French students in my smaller university class was definitely one of them; I would highly recommend that future Wesleyan and Vassar students try to take courses with smaller class sizes if possible. Actually going to exhibits with a French professor in my art history class was another one of the highlights.  	50-70%	Comprehension	Living with a host parent who was invested in having a personal relationship with me, and attending all the lectures at my university classes.

I thought the housing and cultural activities in Bordeaux were excellent.  Personally I had an excellent situation with my host family, and was in a beautiful home with two very sweet parents.  I also loved the excursions, both to Arcachon and to St Emillion.	None in particular, I thought Bordeaux was extremely well organized and definitely one of the highlights of the program.	Talk to French students in your classes and set up an extracurricular activity for yourself early on.	I think that all Wesleyan students should be encouraged to select Paris 7 as their French university the way that Vassar kids are, since I know that my registration process was infinitely easier, and I also believe that I had a more rewarding in-class experience than a number of my friends.  From what I can gather, there seems to be a more intellectual atmosphere among the student body at Paris 7 that is more similar to Wesleyan than at a number of the other French universities.
