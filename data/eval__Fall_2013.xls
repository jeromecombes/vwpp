The ability to visit so much art, and the cultural experience.	If I could have done anything differently, I would have not lived with a host family; it can really inhibit ones ability to experience Paris, succeed academically, and feel grounded and healthy. If I were able to have some say in my host family, I may have decided to live with one; but, after this experience, I regret living with hosts.	The french University system is similar to American state schools, and doesn't facilitate much learning other than rote memorization.	I frankly wish i had not taken any courses at French universities; I did not find it to be an enriching experience. 	70-80%	Speaking	Speaking to French people on a regular basis	Never	Never	Never	Rarely	Often	Not applicable	Not applicable	Not applicable	Helpful	Not helpful		Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	No	The cheese tasting; it was a fun evening.

I would suggest not having classes at Alliance Francaise, and spending time instead speaking and interacting with French people; the classes weren't helpful, and I learned a lot more french spending time conversing.

While living in France, I mostly benefited from:    -constantly speaking French   -being able to travel  -my stage and extracurricular activities   -going to exhibitions and other cultural events  	I would've changed housing.	I've learned that the French university system is relatively disorganized and does little to encourage class participation. Emphasis seemed to be place on learning information, instead of learning concepts, analyses, or ideas. 	I loved the subject of my class and being forced to actively take notes in another language was very helpful in the development of my comprehension skills. It was also nice to learn some vocabulary specific to the subject in another language. 	70-80%	Comprehension	Simply being in an environment where there was no choice but to improve in order to communicate.

The ladies were wonderful to work with and being in a peaceful environment was much needed. It was great to have a chance to look through wonderful art books, and speaking in French with the other women who worked there in addition to the readers was really beneficial for my language skills.	The fact that it was in a town that was small enough to make it feasible for all of us to meet up and get to know each other. 	Housing- great.  Cultural activities- also nice.	Language classes were VERY long and exhausting, especially when jet-lagged! 		Pierre is awesome and exceptionally hard-working. I didn't get a chance to talk to him as much as I would have liked this semester, but he was always helpful and patient. Many thanks, Pierre! 	
I got to explore the city of Paris and experience a new culture.  I also greatly improved my ability to speak, write and understand french.	I would've liked to have interacted with more French students my age.  My class at Paris 7 ended up being mostly Americans or other international students and so I did not really get an opportunity to interact with many french students my age.	I learned that in the french system there is not nearly as personal a relationship between professors and students as there is at vassar, especially in the CM sections of the courses.  Also that the courses are divided into the CM and TD sections and that there is a lot less work/graded work in the french system.	I'd say the most positve aspect was experiencing a different education system and really being able to appreicate the system in place in the states,	50-70%	Comprehension	I would attribute these improvements to interacting with my host family and all the readings/written work I had to do for my classes.

Yes	I did the tour of paris excursion.  I felt like these excursions were a bit forced and I didn't really feel super inclined to interact with the french students and also it didn't seem like most of them wanted to interact much either.	I did meet up with a few french friends that I met before coming to Paris this semester, but other then that I did not do much to meet other french people.	No	Activity																	No		I thought the language intensive was good to get us speaking the language again after not having used much french throughout the summer.  I also really liked all the group activities because it gave me a chance to really get to know the other students in the program.	I thought the housing was great.  I really liked my host family and did not have any problems with them.  I was also very close to the center of the city, which was very convenient.  I also enjoyed the cultural activities because they allowed for group bonding and to get to know things that are specific to the city of Bordeaux.	Space out the activities more.  The first week there weren't as many activities and then there were a ton the entire second week, and it was a bit tiring to have the entire day planned out for most of the second week.	Be willing to be flexible and try new things.  Also to really take advantage of all the free time we have to really explore Paris and get as much out of it as you can.		Gabby Scher
Top benefit has definitely been my language improvement. My french has improved so much in a way it would not have been able to in a classroom. I've also benefited from learning how to live in a city and meeting new people.	I might have come in the sprig instead as I really wanted to study at Science Po. Other than that, no.	I learned a lot about patience, as the French university system is not very communicative and requires a lot of proactivity. I also learned about how they write papers and what that requires.	I enjoyed taking classes with french students and I was very proud of myself for completing french papers and exposes.	70-80%	Writing	The home stay helped a lot with my language, as did the classes all being in french.

I got to see what it was like really living in another country, being immersed.	I would have spoken more French with my friends (sorry, we broke that rule)	The structured nature of the courses and the graded assignments: for example, essays are mapped out, very structured.

It seemed like they were dragged out just for the sake of taking up time. Between the four hour courses and the other courses that we chose, the information we learned was practically useless and very tedious. 	Really try to commit speaking French with other students. You won't have very many other opportunities.		
My French has been improved and the courses at Reid Hall have changed the way I think. I have also benefited a lot from the cultural activities in Paris. 	I should have traveled more over the weekends to other European cities.	Since I've only taken two courses in the art history department , I can't really say that I learned a lot about the French university system. But overall I liked the different perspective on art history at the Sorbonne. For example, my professor of modern/contemporary French art seemed more focused on aesthetics than on psychoanalysis, which is more developed in the States.

Both were very well-organised. 	Nothing in particular. 	Know that most of the French classes will probably not satisfy your expectations. The program in Paris is about experiencing the culture and if you don't think losing on academics at Vassar is worth it, then it is not the right choice for you. However, my time in Paris was very enriching and inspiring in every aspect and I'm so happy I had the chance to participate in the program. The courses at Reid Hall were great and made me step out of my comfort zone in terms of the subjects I was usually taking it Vassar. 		
What I got most out of the program was the demystification of living in Paris, and of parisians themselves. I feel like I've seen very different sides of Pars while I've been here, and now view it as a very complex city with real problems and real people who feel things and deal with Paris every day. It was a struggle to get around sometimes, and I got a little homesick; but now I feel like I've grown as a person and learned more about myself. I've always known that falsely view New York City, or the US as a whole, as some magical land where dreams come true. But I didn't realize that I was doing that with Paris my whole life! That being said, I still met amazing people (both French and American) and had so much exposure to art, french film, and amazing food (which is what I had dreamed about in the first place).	No	I learned that there is a more distant relationship between student and professor, and that they expect you to be more self-disciplined throughout the semester rather than assigning frequent assignments. 	The double challenge of using my French and still trying to express myself clearly, and that I think it turned out okay!	50-70%	Comprehension	The constant interaction and exposure to French conversation, the repeated phrases and words, French radio ads and signs, and speaking with my host family on a daily basis.

They were so inspiring and cool to see (we had studied the chateau in one of my art history classes at Vassar).	No		Not really – maybe some people who were friends with students' host families in the evenings!	No																		Yes	I think I got a lot out of my stage with Katy Sroussy, who was very warm and welcoming.	My favorite part was getting to know people on the program –– because Bordeaux is much smaller than Paris, it was so easy for everyone to meet up and hang out at night and after classes at the Alliance Française. Bordeaux was a really fun town to explore. I also loved our trips to the Dune du Pyla and Saint-Emilion! After Bordeaux, I felt much more prepared to live with a French host family.	I loved my Bordeaux host family and was really glad we got to have that experience. I even had coffee with them when they came to Paris in November! Overall, I felt very lucky with both of my host families. I also thought the wine tasting was actually very helpful in discerning different wines – I felt so lost before. Also, Saint-Emilion remains one of the most beautiful (and old) towns I have ever gotten to see!	I think it went really well. I think the closer students can live to each other in Bordeaux, the better and the easier it will become for everyone to get to know one another. Maybe one thing to add could be a group meeting somewhere, to go through our schedules at the very beginning, just to avoid the intense shock of getting off the plain, so exhausted and tired, and then stepping right into our host families  and having to speak fluent French immediately! 	To understand that the metro, classes, and petty host family issues will be really hard to deal with at some points, and that Paris can be a crazy place! But also to try to take advantage of every single thing you want to do.		
- I can speak French now!   -The program had me immersed culturally by providing trips and guidance all throughout the semester.   -Improve communication skills.  -Overcoming language barriers. 	 I think it's all good! 	The French university is sufficient. It does not really encourage independent thinking nor does it stimulate creativity. It made me appreciate a lot Wesleyan. I also understood that the French university I attended was public and did not have the resources a private university has, mostly. In addition, tuition at a French university is very cheap if compared to tuition in the States, so this affects the availabitly of resources. Overall, I didn't like the French university atmosphere; students should be more involved during the class and the top-down stream of information should be changed.

I'm thrilled to be coming away from my semester in France feeling that I've fully profited from the experience, a feeling that is thanks in no small part to the VWPP program. I was housed with a superb host family, which allowed me to get a wonderful glimpse into French culture and French domestic life and greatly improved my spoken French, my courses at Reid Hall and my tutorat were engaging and highly helpful for my written expression in French, and the cultural excursions offered by the program allowed me to gain an understanding of French culture that I would have found it difficult to garner on my own.	I would have loved to have met more French students, which I would have been able to do for one thing if I had able to continue the activity I started at the beginning of the semester.	That it's a system that must be taken on it's own terms, and not compared to the American! Bureaucracy nightmares aside, I was content with my two courses at the fac, both of which were academically interesting, and allowed me to better understand the French mindset and approach to many academic issues.	I lucked into two courses with interesting subjects and interesting professors. Even if the courses could be frustrating at times, to someone used to a very differently organized educational system, my French comprehension definitely benefitted from the necessity of understanding academic lectures not delivered with foreign students in mind.	70-80%	Speaking	My confidence in speaking is greatly improved from the start of the semester, a fact I attribute simply to the enormous amount of practice we get simply by living with French families and speaking French in and out of class at Reid Hall. I noticed marked improvement in my comprehension and written expression as well, both I think thanks in large part to my classes at Reid Hall and my work with my tutor.

Our excursions outside of Paris were particularly rewarding from an experiential point of view, as they allowed us to see cities and landmarks that differed greatly from the Parisian experience. I particularly enjoyed the receptions with the program and host families because of the communal feel they promoted, and the cultural events (i.e. opera and theater) for the views they gave of French culture, particularly when it would have been difficult for we students to organize attending them on our own.	No		I participated for several weeks in practices for an ultimate frisbee team, but was unable to continue because of an injury.	Yes	Team	Ah Ouh Puc (Ultimate Frisbee)		yann.guinaudeau@gmail.com	Yann Guinaudeau													Yes		I thought the Bordeaux orientation was a highly effective way to start the VWPP program. Firstly, it was excellent as a language immersion, and helped in branching the gap between the United States and Paris. The classes, cultural activities and housing were all designed in a way as to maximize our immersion into the culture, and to promote our adoption of the French language. Secondly, I thought the Bordeaux program did a great job of bringing the group together in a way that it would be more difficult to do in a bigger city like Paris. It was wonderful to already feel a part of a group, and already have made strong friendships by the time we got to Paris.	Cultural activities were great - introducing us to various aspects of French culture and life that were than built upon by programming in Paris. The trip to the Dune de Pyla and to Arcachon was particularly memorable. I lucked into a great host family/mother, and I thought it was great to have effectively every meal a day with her, especially in terms of language immersion. However, it was frustrating at times to be 30 minutes outside of town, especially when most of my peers were in center city.	The first week can be exhausting - remaining aware of that when scheduling activities is important.	Allow yourself to be uncomfortable. The study abroad experience can be sometimes difficult and often tiring - especially when so much of your day-to-day life never ceases to feel new. But it can also be exciting and challenging in all of the right ways and sometimes even absolutely sublime. Ask questions, push yourself to speak in French and to do things you might not do back in your home country, and  do your best to not lose the sense of wonder with which you first see the city. Paris is not something out of a fairytale - it is a place where real people learn, work, and live. But it is also a city that captures the imagination and can be full of surprise and suspense and beauty. Treat it as such.	VWPP was an excellent program from top to bottom. Thanks for a great semester!	Max Owen-Dunow
