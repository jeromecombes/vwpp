Fair	Good	Always open	Always fair	Very helpful	Very encouraging	One exposé (15 minutes), one commentaire composé (3-4 pages), one dissertation (7-8 pages), one final paper (6-7 pages)	Mostly		I had a lot of difficulty contextualizing the readings. It would have been very helpful to have received more background information on the events, figures, and chronology of the French Revolution at the beginning of the semester. It also would have been better to get our weekly written assignments assigned earlier in the week.

French Revolution	Graille	Fairly strenuous	Comfortably	Comfortably	Yes		Almost always	We were required to write a small 1-page resume of the readings for most classes, and the classes were almost exclusively based on the readings.	Almost always	Again, it was an extremely discussion-based class.	Some of the time	Patrick was very encouraging of questions, but I felt that the material was clear and well-explained for the most part.	Somewhat clear	Very clear	Somewhat clear		Not applicable	Yes	Yes		Good	Good	Always open	Always fair	Very helpful	Encouraging	Every week, we had a small, 1-1.5 page paper resuming the readings. Otherwise, we had a 3-4 page commentaire du texte, as well as a 7-8 page essay and a 6-7 page final paper.	Mostly		I feel like discussions would have benefitted from more structure or more detailed questions - a lot of the time, we were just asked about our thoughts on the readings, which was a little too general for me to know what was expected of me.	
Installations, Space	Kraguly	Moderate	Comfortably	Comfortably	Yes		Some of the time	We had a couple of readings, but never talked about them in class.	Almost never/never	It was mostly a lecture format - I didn't realize until the end of the session, when Mme. Kraguly asked us to participate more, that it was even an option. I didn't feel like there was much opportunity for us to voice opinions, as she never asked about them - she only ever asked us if we thought the material was clear.	Some of the time		Not clear	Very clear	Very clear			Yes	Yes		Excellent	Good	Rarely open	Always fair	Extremely helpful	Very encouraging	A 10-minute oral presentation, as well as a 4-5 page final paper - both on the work of an artist assigned to us by Mme. Kraguly. We were also asked to keep a journal of the visits we made to exhibitions every week.	Mostly

French Revolution	Graille	Fairly strenuous	Comfortably	Comfortably	No	I didn't attend the last class because it was a rescheduling of a previous class that he had to miss, and I had already bought tickets to take a trip that day.	Some of the time	I read parts of all of the readings, but I can't honestly say that I read every reading carefully. The readings were just very long, and the main ideas could be extrapolated within a few pages rather than always reading everything extremely closely.	Most of the time		Some of the time	I didn't always have questions to ask.	Somewhat clear	Very clear	Very clear			Yes	No	Like I mentioned above, I missed the last visit (it was on the same day as the rescheduled class), because he hadn't already told us about it, and I had already purchased tickets for a day trip that day.	Excellent	Good	Always open	Always fair	Extremely helpful	Very encouraging	Every week we had a few readings and about a page to write in response to a question about the readings. We also had one exposé and three papers.	Mostly	I don't know what the goals of the course were.	I really wish we'd dedicated more time at the beginning of the semester to just relearning the events of the French Revolution. I'd learned about it in 9th grade, so I don't remember much. I feel like this class would have been a lot more rewarding and interesting if I'd had a basis of knowledge about the French Revolution itself. I think the readings were well chosen and gave an interesting perspective on the topic, and we had a lot of variety of topics to read about it and the class discussions were fine, but I don't think I learned much (other than improving my French) since I couldn't put the readings into context.	
Installations, Space	Kraguly	Light	Comfortably	Comfortably	Yes		Almost never/never	There were only two readings the entire semester and we literally never discussed them.	Some of the time	I was not aware that we were expected to participate. There were no "discussions," as the class purely consisted of the professor showing a slideshow and lecturing the entire time. She never asked us questions and never paused to allow us to say our opinions. I rarely had questions, but when I did, I did ask them. However, one of the last classes of the semester, the professor expressed displeasure at our general lack of participation. I was honestly pretty shocked, since again, there was not a single time that she'd asked us our thoughts or paused to let us speak. I wasn't about to interrupt her in the middle of her lecture and just say, "I like this piece of art because of the lighting." It didn't seem that she wanted our opinions until it was too late.	Some of the time	The lectures were pretty thorough so I didn't have a lot of questions.	Not clear	Not clear	Not clear			Yes	Yes		Excellent	Excellent	Open sometimes	Fair sometimes	Very helpful	Very encouraging	We had one exposé and one final paper.	Mostly	I don't know what the goals were for the course, but I did get a lot of exposure to different artists and types of art installations that I wouldn't have had otherwise.	I really enjoyed learning about the material and I really liked the visits to museums and galleries. However, the grading was alarming, to say the least. We only had two readings that we never discussed. 25% of the grade was an exposé and 25% of the grade is the final paper. I have no idea what the other 50% is. 25% was supposed to be "museum visits" and a "journal" that we were supposed to keep, but at the end of the semester she said we didn't have to turn the journal in. Does that mean that 25% of the grade is just showing up to our outings? Then 25% of the grade was participation. Like I said earlier, she literally never gave us the opportunity to share our opinions, but then seemed angry that we didn't just interrupt her regularly to say what we thought. I understand wanting us to ask questions, but if she doesn't ask us our opinions on the art, I'm not going to just jump in while she's speaking and say my personal feelings about it. No one would care and it would just be self-indulgent (again though, simply because she NEVER ASKED).

Writing on France today	Collet	Moderate	Comfortably	Comfortably	Yes		Almost always		Almost always		Almost never/never	The class was very straightforward and questions were not necessary most of the time. 	Very clear	Very clear	Very clear		Not applicable	Yes	Yes		Good	Good	Always open	Mostly fair	Not helpful	Not encouraging	Midterm paper, final paper, exposé, short written assignments each week	Mostly		The class seemed to be very easy, we received almost no work at the beginning and our readings were very simple, in fact our professor treated us as if we had the French capacities of eleven year olds, but then when we handed in our midterm papers I was very disappointed to see that my grade was so low - it turns out that she had expected things of us that we were unaware of, because while we were in class the material seemed quite easy and there were never difficult questions about what we had read/watched etc. Also I felt that her comments on our papers were unhelpful, and a little bit unrealistic (saying that about 80% of my sentences were too long, when no other professor had really every said this to me) and, the day that we received these comments was also the day that we had to hand in our second paper which was unfortunate. Overall this was not what I was expecting from this course at all and I did not enjoy it very much.

Absolutely	I really enjoyed this course because I was able to see sides of Paris that I definitely would have missed otherwise.	I loved everything about this course, except that sometimes our homework was assigned last-minute.	
French Revolution	Graille	Strenuous	With some difficulty	Comfortably	No	There was a make-up class that I was not able to attend due to scheduling conflicts. 	Almost always		Some of the time	I found the material uninteresting and difficult to comment on.	Some of the time		Very clear	Very clear	Very clear			Yes	No	One of the visits was on a non-class day and I already had something scheduled that day. 	Good	Good	Open sometimes	Mostly fair	Very helpful	Encouraging	One exposée, une explication du texte, une dissertation, un devoir final - and small 1-2 page assignments along the way. 	Mostly	The writing assignments helped me better analyze and understand the material, as well as put it in a larger context. 	Many of the readings I found too difficult for our level or not at all engaging. We were reading primary texts, and many of them had different spellings, phrases, and word usages that made it much more difficult to understand, and in my opinion not really worth the effort.

I really enjoyed this class and it was a good introduction to art history.

Good	Excellent	Always open	Mostly fair	Extremely helpful	Encouraging	Three papers  A lot of readings for every class  Weekly written assignments	Mostly	It kept us writing every week which is the purpose of a writing-intensive course. 	I think my only comment would be around the clarity of the course description. This class is not a history class on the french revolution, it is a class on literature OF the french revolution. I think we were all caught off guard by that aspect of it.	Melissa

Somewhat	I was pretty unclear as to what the goals were in this course.  I felt that it was very poorly organized, and that often the readings often had little to do with the discussion.  Also it was hard to figure out what the connections were between the different readings.

Good	Fair	Always open	Always fair	Very helpful	Encouraging	We had weekly writing assignments to make sure we were keeping up with/ synthesizing the reading.  I found these to be helpful, but sometimes they weren't assigned until two days before class and I wish I had known about their existence earlier. We had a commentaire du texte, a dissertation, and a devoir final.  This is probably the class that improved my writing the most because we had to do so much of it. We had one exposé, and the expectations for that could have been clearer.	Mostly	The dissertation, which required us to go back through our readings to talk about the ideal of equality, was a good assignment because it forced me to go back through everything and make sure I understood it, but also a little too vague because the topic of "equality" is so vast.	Some of the readings just didn't provide enough content for a full course of discussion, so that would probably be my biggest complaint.  Also, a more general timeline of the Revolution at the start of the course would have been helpful, even though I did enjoy that we got to explore the topic through so many genres.

This way it would be clearer what is expected by the professor.	Amount of work is fair.  the materials studied are relevant and interesting. However, the class discussion are sometimes not very enthusiastic. Sometimes the questions designed by the professor for discussion are not intriguing or interesting enough to stimulate discussions. Sometimes it feels as if the questions are too simple and no one bothered to answer.
