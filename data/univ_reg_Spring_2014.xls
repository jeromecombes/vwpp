Bourenane	Sarah					3rd	2nd	1st	4th		As an international studies major concentrating in history and political science, I think that Paris 7 would offer the best selection of coursework that pertains to my academic interests. I try to have a humanitarian perspective in my studies, and in addition to my declared major, I am also interested in sociology, geography, economics and philosophy. Paris 4 also offers great areas of study, and would allow me to be exposed to a more cultural and anthropological perspective, but I think Paris 7 is the best fit considering its wide focus on the social sciences and humanities.

Cabrera	Matthew	Independent (Psycholinguistics)	French & Francophone Studies (Undeclared)		Music Composition (Undeclared)	3rd	4th	1st	2nd		Paris 7 specializes in humanities such as linguistics and social sciences. It offers a number of different courses in the psycholinguistics discipline, presenting me with opportunities that cannot be found at Vassar or the other Parisian institutions. The school has plenty of scholarly resources available, including several research centers that each focus on a different subfield of linguistics. Specific courses that have piqued my interest and correspond directly to my major include 'Semantics' and 'Psycholinguistics,' available at the third-year level.

Carpenter	Gabriella	College of Letters		Math		2nd	3rd	1st	4th		In order to major in math, I really need to take one math class that could count as a math elective while in Paris, so I really need to study at Paris 7. If this isn't possible, there are many classes that interest me at Paris 3 that would overlap with my other major, College of Letters, but not being able to take a math class while abroad would make double majoring much more difficult for me.

Dawson	Stephanie	College of Letters		Religion		2nd	1st	4th	3rd		While abroad, I wish to further my studies in philosophy, literature, and religion, all of which pertain directly to my majors. Paris 4 offers the strongest university program in philosophy and among the strongest in literature. Paris 4 also offers courses in Arab studies, which suit my studies in religion. Because France is home to one of the largest Muslim populations in Europe, I feel that I should focus on Arab and Muslim studies during my time there.     Paris 3 also offers a wide variety of courses in religion including Indian, Arab, Jewish, and Iranian studies. Of these I would probably still study Arab cultures. Paris 3 also offers courses in literature.

Don	Robert	Music		Psychology		4th	2nd	1st	3rd		I'm interested in studying both psychoanalysis and am happy with the variety of courses offered at Paris 7. Ideally I'd like to also study a music-related course (could be within sociology, for example) as well as psychoanalysis but can be flexible.

Durr	Katherine	Art History	French		Religion	2nd	1st				As an art history student at Vassar, I have been informed that Paris 4 is the only university where I will be able to have an integrated and comprehensive experience studying the fine arts and its intersections with other fields in the humanities, such as a philosophy, theology, and art theory. I hope that this request can be accommodated in order that I may continue my coursework in Paris as planned.

Fitzgerald	Julia	French		Drama (undeclared)		1st	2nd	3rd	4th		As a French major, I would like to take courses in French literature while in Paris. Paris 3 has the most options in this department, including a number of courses on literature in a specific historical context, an approach that works well with my current major program. Paris 4 also has several L2 literature courses that I could take, while Paris 7 does not have enough options in this area.

Franchi	Sophia	English		French		1st	3rd	2nd	4th		Paris 3 is my first choice because studying there would be a way to continue the academic program I began at Wesleyan. What caught my interest was that the lettres modernes formation offers courses on comparative literature in addition to French literature. I've always been interested in studying literature in multiple languages, as my double major attests. I am also fluent in Italian, so taking a class like "Littérature Générale et Comparée" would be an exciting way for me to condense my interests. Also, Paris 3 also offers philosophy classes under the lettres modernes--parcours philosophie. I have taken five philosophy classes at Wesleyan, so I would love to take a class like "Histoire de la philosophie moderne et contemporaine" to experience what is sure to be a different point of view than I was exposed to here. Paris 3 is therefore the best match for my academic interests.    I think that Paris 7 is the second-best match for my interests. It offers courses on English/French translation, which I think would be fascinating to take as a double major in French and English. Also, they have courses on “Domaines étrangers” that I would be interested in for the reasons I mentioned above.

Hollithron	Henry	Computer Science		History				1st			I understand that Paris 7 constitutes the best institution in which I can pursue both my major interests: history and computer science. As no other university has been recommended, I do not have a second choice.	I have no interest in the calendar in this instance.

Issroff	Daniel	French Studies		History		3rd	2nd	1st	4th		Basically, as a history major I'm just looking for a university with a strong history program.  It seems to me that both Paris 4 and Paris 7 have good history courses and if this is the case, I would be happy to be in either of them.

Jia	Claire	Political Science				2nd	3rd	1st	4th		I am a Political Science major at Amherst College, with an interest in history and world literature. Paris IIV has the most diverse array of courses and would most likely have political science/international relations courses that interest me. I absolutely NEED to take two political science courses while abroad in order to complete my major, so I plan on taking at least one political science course at a French university and one with the VWPP program (assuming that the program offers seminars concerning political science). Paris III is renowned for its literature and film classes, which I believe would supplement my social-studies-heavy courseload well.

Lawal	Olayinka	Sociology	International Relations			3rd	2nd	1st	4th		As a Sociology major, Paris 7 is the best fit school for my major requirements. Sociology is on of their mains social science focus and I'm sure that my chances of getting into a sociology course are greatest at Paris 7. Likewise, Paris 4 would provide sociology course options for me in some scope because they still have a wider social science option than Paris 3 which would not allow me any opportunity to take Sociology courses.

Leatherman	Zachary	Psychology				1st	3rd	2nd	4th	5th	As a psychology major, my primary interests are in the social sciences. However, I also do not have to take any psychology courses next semester to fulfill my requirements, so I would love to explore courses in theatre, literature, or art. Honestly, I would be very happy to take courses anywhere in Paris, and I do not NEED to be placed anywhere specific.

Medvedev	Danila	German Studies	Social, Cultural, and Political Theory	Psychology		4th	1st	2nd	3rd		I want to take (and need to since I cannot discontinue studying the language for a semester) an advanced class on German short stories that I am extremely interested in offered at Paris IV. I also need to take a philosophy class if I want to get a Social, Cultural, and Political Theory Certificate. I was thinking of studying at CIPh, but they do not offer advanced German classes. Frankly, that would be really hard for me to fulfill my goals anywhere but Paris IV.

Mike	Sherrel	Government				2nd	3rd	1st	4th		I am a prospective government major and I need to be in Paris 7 in order to take classes that will count towards my major. I have thoroughly looked through all of the universities and Paris 7 has the classes that I need.  In fact, I have already received approval for a government class from the chair of the government department so to not be accepted into Paris 7 would affect me significantly.

Mirchand	Drue	Romance Studies				2nd	3rd	1st	4th		I want to enroll at Paris 7 because I'd like to take advantage of the wide breadth of courses offered, particularly those in French/English translation in the department of Anglophone studies.

Reidy	Haylle	Economics	International Relations			2nd	3rd	1st	4th		Being an economics major with a concentration in International Relations, it is very important to me that I will be able to take courses in the social sciences, specifically politics and history. Being at either Paris 7 or Paris 3 would give me a wide range of courses that would allow me to continue studying in my preferred field, with Paris 7 having more options in terms of political/government courses.

Satayopas	Borworn	Mathematics		Classics		3rd	1st	2nd			Because of my credit number, I must take at least one upper level (non-grammar) Latin course while participating.  Ideal, I would be taking at least one Latin course and one mathematics course, and I will still trying to find a way to do it, but if I have to pick one (None of the choices offers both), I have to take Latin.

Slap	William	Film Studies				1st	4th	2nd			I am a film major, and I have found a great passion for the cinema. I think that Paris 3 is the best unviersity for me because its cinema program is the strongest and will allow me to continue with my studies in a new and exciting way. Paris 7 has more general education courses in the medias and criticism which i think would tie into my studies nicely as well.

Steele	Elena	International Studies	Political Science		History	3rd	1st	2nd			I chose Paris 4 and Paris 7 because they seem to offer more courses in political science and history which are the concentrations in my International Studies major. I researched all of the universities and I saw that the largest selection of humanities and social science courses are offered at Paris 4 and Paris 7. Paris 4 has the largest selection and is known for its international approach while Paris 7 is known for having multidisciplinary curriculum. I am interested in taking classes on EU government and France's colonial history and I believe these two universities will be best at allowing me to take the courses I want next semester.

Struve	Juliana	English	French		Art History	2nd	1st	3rd	4th		My biggest concern in choosing a university is to choose one that can help me fulfill at least one credit for my Art History correlate and one for my English major. Paris 4 is my first choice because, based on my limited research, it seems to offer courses in both art and english literature (especially comparative literature which is my focus), which would be ideal for me in fulfilling requirements for both art history and english.

Wright	Claire	COL		French		2nd	1st	3rd	4th		As I wrote in my application, I hope to take a philosophy and an art history course at Paris 4, the only university with classes in both disciplines. I intend to start my COL thesis on the history and psychology of existential French philosophy so I want to take a course to assist me in this research; I think the Histoire de la Philosophie Contemporaine course would provide a useful starting point for my thesis. Additionally, although I cannot study Art History at Wesleyan due to requirements, I believe an understanding of art would supplement my COL studies, developing my knowledge of society. Therefore, I hope to take an art history course, preferably Histoire Des Arts Du XIX-XX siècle. While in Paris, I hope to broaden my education and start my thesis; Paris 4 provides the best opportunity for me to do so.    Paris 3 offers several literature and history courses, including Questions de Littérature and L’Europe et Ses Nations 1914-1945, that would supplement my understanding of European History and Culture, enriching my learning in the COL. Additionally, I believe studying history and literature at Paris 3 would provide an interesting comparison to my studies at Wesleyan.

Zheutlin	Alexander	Religion				2nd	3rd	1st	4th		I am a religion major, I am also interested in urban studies. Paris 7, with its emphasis on humanities and social sciences, seems to be the best fit for my academic interests. I prefer a university with course variety, which is why Paris 7 is my first choice. Paris 3 also caters to the social sciences and humanities so its a logical second choice.    I am interested in religion and its social ramifications. I would particularly like to study the relationship between Islam and France.

Zinser	Sophie	College of Letters	Middle Eastern Studies	French Studies		2nd	1st	4th	3rd		I am interested in studying at Paris IV because I am interested in studying journalism and Arabic history while in Paris. I am assistant news editor of the Argus and am interested in pursuing a career in international journalism. Wesleyan does not offer many courses in the field of journalism. Paris IV offers a unique specialization in their Information and Communication Licence called Media and Communication, which allows students to study both printed news and digital journalism. I also study the Arabic language, and Paris IV's Foreign Language, Literature, and Civilizations (Arabic) Licence demands courses in the history of the Arabic world, which would be fascinating to study in a city with such a large Arabic population.  Paris IV also offers an interdisciplinary Philosophy and Sociology Licence, which would offer a unique lens through which to study philosophy, one of the key disciplines of my COL major.    Paris III is my second choice because it offers Arabic courses, including Sociology of the Arab World, which I would not have an opportunity to study while at Wesleyan.      I would also like to take one course at the CIPh.	Paris 4	High School Diploma	2012	United States	Madison	Connecticut	Sophomore	College of Letters	2012	College of Letters	Philosophy	Non
