Bird	Emma	Yes	Yes		Yes, I lived in France for a month the summer after my sophomore year of high school (through the Experiment in International Living program). It was a group of twelve students and one group leader. We stayed in a hotel in Paris for a week, then traveled to St. Raphaël (next to St. Tropez) where each student did a home stay with a family for about ten days. The we traveled to Nice, Cannes, Monaco, the Italian Riviera and then back to Paris.  -  - I had also been to Paris once before on a family vacation. We stayed for about a week. - I have also been to Spain and London before on separate family vacation. Each of those trips was about a week as well.	Yes, as mentioned above I did the Experiment in International Living program in France. I lived with a host family for about ten days in St. Raphaël. It was a great experience and by the third night of my home stay I was dreaming in French. The food was also delicious and the family's house was a few blocks from the beach. It was a great way to be immersed in French life and culture. I am excited to have the opportunity to do a longer home stay in Paris for study abroad because I think it will drastically improve my French and my knowledge of French culture. - However, my previous home stay experience was not entirely positive. It was apparent that the family was hosting me solely for the purpose of renting out a room. Also, towards the end of my visit my host mother became mean and stopped wanting me to go to group events where all the host families of the other students where invited as well. She yelled at me and my group leader (I am not sure why). In the end, she refused to open the gift I had brought her from the U.S. and when she dropped me off at the train station she drove away without saying goodbye.  - I would still consider my overall home stay experience to be positive, although I am a bit nervous for this upcoming one considering how the previous one ended.	I live with my parents, brother, and two corgi dogs. - My dad is a political history curator at the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of American History. - My mom is an exhibit designer at the Smithsonian Institution's Office of Exhibit Central, so she designs exhibits for whichever museum needs them. - My brother, who is eighteen, is currently a senior in high school and will be attending Hobart for college in the fall. -  - My extended family is quite large, my dad has three siblings and my mom has four siblings. I have sixteen first cousins in total.	No	No	No	I have lived in an apartment before with friends, but only for about a week on vacations to ski or to go to the beach. We cooked for ourselves in those weeklong vacations because it is cheaper than eating out. -  - I am very excited to live in an French apartment in Paris. I am also hopeful that I could pick up some cooking tips from the host family to improve my own cooking skills.	My main reason is to improve my French language skills. I think that I am at the point in my French classes where I need to be fully immersed in the language to really push myself. I have also always loved the city of Paris and have known I want to study abroad there. Also, as an Urban Studies I have learned a lot about the redesign of Paris under Baron Haussmann (I am currently writing a research paper on him), as well as French art and architecture. I am also curious to experience the French education system and see how it differs from that in the U.S.	I am an Urban Studies major with an Art History correlate. My main interests are art, architecture, city development, and museums. Last summer I worked at the Smithsonian interning with an American Art curator and this summer I am interning at a real estate development firm. As for art and architecture I particularly enjoy works from the 19th century to present day. I am also interested in sustainable and environmental design.  - Also, currently I am doing an economics/environmental studies independent study class where I am focusing on how to make Vassar's Dining Services food more sustainable. We are looking into ways to buy from more local vendors and have more of the Campus Dining food USDA certified organic. Additionally, we are working to create a green house next to the dining hall that will provide a portion of the lettuce for Campus Dining. I am also working with Food Committee to create better labels in the dining hall that say the complete nutritional information as well as if the food was locally produce. I could definitely see myself continuing my work in sustainable agriculture or working with Food Committee in the future.	I enjoy taking Yoga and Pilates classes as well as exercising at the gym.  - I am also very involved with Vassar Greens, the environmental club on campus.  - I enjoy seeing films occasionally and reading when I have the spare time. - I also work on the style section of the fashion magazine, Contrast, as well as model for some photo shoots. - I am currently in a tennis class, which is fun. - I also played Varsity Volleyball in high school and am waiting for Vassar to offer a volleyball physical education course that I could take. - I also really enjoy shopping, especially in Paris!	No	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	I am not allergic to any foods, but: -  - I don't really like any type of seafood, although I will eat is occasionally to be polite. - Also, I don't like eggs (hardboiled, scrambled, omelets, etc.), but I do like and do eat eggs when they are an ingredient in a dish (cake, pastries, etc.) - Lastly, I do not drink glasses of milk or put it in my cereal, but I will eat yogurt, cheese, or products containing milk.	n/a	Yes	I am allergic to cats.	I am concerned about the policy of not having friends over (or only sometimes if allowed by the family). I think when the weather is nice it will be easy to meet up at a park or garden, but when it is cold it might be more difficult to meet up with friends without spending too much money. For example, if we should not really go to each others houses often then we might go to cafes more and thus spend more money.  - I am also concerned about being located in one of the outer arrondissements because I would prefer to be located more centrally.  - My last major concern is that it will be difficult to interact with the host family because I can be shy when meeting new people, especially when I am not fluent in French.			I love dogs and I would not mind a host family with children. It could be fun to have a host sibling who is my age or to have other siblings. I am very neat and organized, so I would hope the host family would be too. I am really looking to be fully integrated into the family and to learn things from their daily life, whether it is how to cook or which restaurants are good or where to visit in Paris, etc. I hope the family would be interested in striking up conversation with me because I fear I may be a bit shy at first (although I will try to be more outgoing and talkative). As for study habits and sleeping habits I think I am about average in both categories. I can study at any point in the day or night and perhaps will do so in the library depending on its location/my schedule. I go to bed around midnight on weekdays and perhaps later on weekends if I decide to go out with friends. I tend to wake up between 10 and 11:30 on the weekends because I enjoy sleeping in sometimes. For noise, I think I am also about average and I can put up with some noise level. Although it would be nice to not have my room right next to the kitchen.
Buxton	Nicholas	No	Yes		I lived in France while studying abroad in Montpellier, France for one semester. I studied there during the spring semester of 2011 for a total of five months. I lived in an apartment with another foreign student where the landlady lived right across the hall and we interacted with her on a daily basis. I took language and literature classes at the local university (Montpellier III), had an internship as an assistant English teacher in a collège, and immersed myself in daily French life and culture. My French improved a great deal while abroad and I resultantly have a good command of the French language (I also live in the French Language House at Tufts University, so I continue to speak French on a daily basis). I absolutely loved my experience studying and living in France and it definitely inspired me to want to study abroad again - this time in Paris with VWPP.  -  - Additionally, I have traveled extensively; I have visited many countries in Europe, North Africa, North America and the Caribbean. The countries I have visited where French is a main language include France, Tunisia, Morocco, Canada (Québec), Belgium, Switzerland, and Guadeloupe.	In addition to the semester that I studied abroad in Montpellier, I did a home stay for two weeks after graduating from high school with a French family in Nord Pas de Calais. It was a wonderful experience. I was hosted by a family of two boys (20 years old and 8 years old) and two parents. I really appreciated and valued living with a family that included children around my age. I became very close with the whole family; however, I became especially close with the 20 year old and remain good friends with him to this day. Hanging out with him enabled me to better experience French culture and especially that of the French youth. Since my host brother and I were close in age, we had a lot in common and we really connected. We spent a lot of time together and he introduced me to his friends and invited me to hang out with them often. Because of this positive experience of living in a family with children around my age, I would really love to be placed in a family in Paris that also includes children around my age. I would really love and appreciate the opportunity to connect with French youths in a home environment. I understand that housing placement in families with children are not the most common; but if at all possible, I would greatly appreciate being placed in a family with children around my age.	My parents are divorced and I live with my mom and my brother (when I am not away at university). My mother is an artist, my father works in finance, and my brother is 21 years old. My brother has autism; I love him as any brother would love his brother, but it is frankly hard to always be there and support him. This is another reason why I would like to live in a family with children around my age: to experience living under the same roof as someone my age and be able to relate over our shared interests and hopefully do fun things together. Furthermore, it would be wonderful to be able to spend time with a big, healthy, and happy French family and be able to have the experience of living with them and bonding with them.	Yes	Yes	Yes	I lived in an apartment with another foreign student while studying abroad in Montpellier, France. While we interacted daily with the landlady who lived next door, we lived very independently, cooking our own food, cleaning, and being respectful of each other's preferences. Because of this experience, I know I can live very independently. Also, I am very respectful of the preferences and customs of those with whom I am living. During both the home stay with the family in Calais and my semester abroad, I made a big effort to reach out and interact with my French hosts (the landlady in the case of my semester abroad).	My principal reason for coming to Paris is to have an amazing experience by immersing myself in French culture, making wonderful new French friends and spending quality time with them, and sharing moments that I will remember for the rest of my life. In short, my principal reason for coming to Paris is to have a great time. I am serious about my studies and will spend the amount of time needed to do well in my classes. But I really just want to have a great time. As I did while studying abroad in Montpellier, I plan on fully immersing myself in French culture and being outgoing so that I meet and become friends with other French students with whom I share common interests. I also want to further improve the level of my French speaking ability to become as close to native fluency as possible.	My main academic interests are literature (especially French literature), poetry, music, art, languages, and to a lesser extent, international relations.	My biggest passion is music. I love going to concerts and playing music. I plan on bringing my acoustic guitar with me to Paris. I can play quietly, but it would be ideal to be placed in a family that wouldn't mind me playing guitar (and, better yet, in a family that is musically inclined themselves). Apart from music, I love hanging out with friends, meeting up with people for drinks or meals, going for walks, spending time outside and exploring the different neighborhoods of a city. I enjoy the arts and going to related events such as film screenings, gallery openings, and art shows. I also enjoy taking it easy and watching films and reading at home. I love learning foreign languages (I am learning Spanish now), traveling, playing sports (especially running and playing soccer).	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None	None of concern here		No	My principal priority would be to live with a family that has children close to my age (university or high school students would be ideal). Even a family with children who are much younger than me would be preferable to a single parent with no children at home. My second priority would be to live in a neighborhood close to the center of Paris.			I do feel that it is necessary to mention that I am gay and I, therefore, strongly desire to be placed in a liberal family with liberal political views who will embrace the fact that I am gay. I need my home while in Paris to be a safe place where I feel comfortable with regards to my sexuality. I don't think this will be an issue as I am very comfortable with my sexuality and I am confident in general. However, I want to mention this now to avoid being placed in a family who might discriminate against gay people or who don't support gay rights (such as the right for gay people to marry and adopt children). In general, I would like my host family to be very open minded and accepting of differences in other people.  -  - Also, I mentioned that I could live with smokers. I would be totally fine with that as long as they were to smoke out a window or on a terrace or outside the apartment. I would not want to live with a regular smoker who smokes inside the apartment.
Choi	Lily		Yes		I have traveled to Greece, Italy, Barcelona, Portugal, Korea, Japan, the Bahamas, and Canada. However, these trips have been solely for vacation and I spent at most, a week in each country. I have never been to France nor have I lived in a foreign country.	No, I have never had a home stay experience.	I live with my parents and my older brother. My brother is 22 and he goes to a community college near our home. He is fairly loud, but as he has a car, he is rarely in the house. My mom works at a nail salon near our house and my father own his own pawn shop/jewelry business in Queens, about an hour away. I am very close to my parents; on the days my mom has off from work, we usually spend quality time together. But I also like having my own space and time on my own, within the home especially. My father I don't see as often because he works six days a week until the evening. But he and I are very alike in that we are both quiet and while we enjoy spending time with the family, we like to have our own space.	No	Yes	No	I have never lived in an independent living situation, but I have lived in dorms for a very long time, since sophomore year of high school. I went to a boarding school, so I've had about four different roommates. While I have never had to cook for myself as my primary source of meals, in each dorm/school, I have had access to a communal kitchen. I enjoy cooking and I hope to cook for myself more in the future. In terms of roommates, especially in a new situation, I've enjoyed having a roommate because it's not to not be alone and to have a friend in the same situation, but I am a fairly independent and self-sufficient person, so I do like to have time alone.	I am going to Paris to study in a beautiful and culturally vibrant city, to learn more about the culture, and to become more fluent in the language. I am also going because I am wary of new situations and living in a completely different city while speaking a different language (basically living outside of my comfort zone), so I'd like to become more comfortable studying and living in a completely new environment.	Sociology and English (especially writing)	I love to write and read: I am a reporter for the Misc and I am part of Helicon, the literary magazine. I enjoy art, whether it's going to museums or making art. I like to box (as in, boxing) and I also like spinning (indoor cycling) and working out so hopefully I can find a gym in Paris. I also love films and plays, so I am excited to be in a city where films are a huge part of the culture.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		I generally eat very healthily, so I would feel comfortable living in a home where there are fresh fruits and vegetables present.	Yes		Although I understand why overnight guests are not permitted, I do have family and friends that might like to visit me over the course of the semester and I would like to travel, so I might spend some time not in the host family's home. I know that I would have to inform my host in every case, but I guess my principal concern is how free I would really be to come and go as I wish, as I would like to maintain a good relationship with my host. This will obviously not be a common occurrence.			I love children and animals, especially dogs. I am fairly neat and I am comfortable with cleaning regularly. I can help out around the house if needed (cooking, cleaning, doing dishes, etc). I usually study in the evening and sleep around 10 or 11, which is early for most students, but I would prefer for it to be quiet when I study/sleep. Other than that, I'm fine with noise. I like to play music in the morning when I'm getting ready or if I'm going out for an evening with friends, not too loudly, but perhaps that might pose an issue for some hosts.
Feldman	Jennifer	No	Yes		I travelled to France with my family when I was twelve for about two weeks. I have also been on family trips of around two weeks to Italy, Canada and England when I was younger (6-10).	I have never had a home stay experience with a foreign family or hosted an international student.	My family consists of my mom, dad, brother who is 22, and dog Kobi, who is a Shiba Inu. We are very close and spend a lot of time together. When we are all home we have dinner as a family most nights.	No	No	No		I am eager to spend the semester studying in Paris because I want to improve my ability to speak French and am looking forward to experiencing a different culture and way of life since I have spent my whole life so far in America .	I am majoring in Art History and am considering minoring in French. I have also recently become interested in psychology.	I really love to cook. When I am home, I spend a lot of time baking and experimenting in my family's kitchen. During high school I had my own baking business and interned at a food magazine last summer. I also studied ballet in high school and was considering becoming a professional dancer. I no longer dance, but I still love everything ballet related and look forward to seeing the Paris Opera Ballet perform. I also am very interested in art and enjoy going to museums and exhibitions.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	I cannot eat raw onions or garlic.	I do not eat fast food or junk food.	Yes	I am not allergic to anything.	I am a fairly shy person, so I would like a situation where I feel comfortable spending time with my host family because I really do want to improve my French and have the fullest experience I can while in Paris. I also would like if my host family also enjoyed cooking and eating together because I think this would be a good way for me to bond and get to know them. Also I would prefer that the family I stay with does not eat fast food or junk food regularly because I don't. I do not mind dogs but I would prefer that the family does not have any other pets.			I like children, but since I am the youngest in my family don't have much experience with them. I would not be opposed to living with a family with children (younger or older). I like dogs but would prefer that the family I am staying with does not have any other pets. I am interested in cooking/food, ballet, and art. I am fairly neat but not incredibly so. I am fairly quiet and would like my family to be fairly quiet as well. I can sleep through almost anything.
Gibbel	Katherine		Yes		Yes. I have traveled to Paris as a kid (age 10) and again last summer. I stayed in Paris for about 5 days with a friend and then I spent a week in the south of France with my family.	In High School I studied abroad in Istanbul for three weeks and hosted a Turkish student for three weeks. Although relatively short, the exchange made me see my own life in a very new way. I loved being able to have someone my own age around and Selin and I became very good friends. I think this previous experience makes me value having a host sibling about my age around the house.	I have two parents, who are divorced. My dad is the Vice President of College Advancement at Baruch College. My mom is the president of Classroom Inc., and non-profit that deals with literacy issues. I have one brother, age 16 (he is awesome). My dad is remarried, and I get along well with my stepmom and stepbrother. My mom now identifies as queer and her partner is about to move in to her apartment.	Yes	Yes	Yes	The best part about my living situation now is coming home to a living room or kitchen with another person to whom I can talk to about my day or what's on my mind. I do, however, also enjoy my own space and quiet time.	I want to speak French well; I think it's very important to speak more than one language for so many reasons. Beyond that, my reason for coming to Paris is that it's a city so steeped in culture that I want to explore.	Literature and feminist studies.	I play ultimate frisbee here at Wesleyan. I also teach sex ed to high schoolers in the CT area with the group ASHA. This semester I am one of the coordinators for the Environmental Organizers Network. In my (infrequent) spare time, I like to run, read, or write.	No	No	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	No	No			No	Not to my certain knowledge.	I would like to have someone my age living where I live.			I love small children and cats, so I would be fine living in a situation with either of those. I have a general order to my room, but sometimes I can be a little messy. I try to get 8 hours of sleep every night (usually 12am-8am or so). I like to study during the day, and I hate studying late at night.
Gregoline	Emma	Yes	Yes		Yes — I have traveled to Paris for 10 days in 2000, and for one week in 2008. I have also traveled to London for 10 days in 2004. I recently traveled to Toronto in late 2012 for three days.	No, but I am looking forward to it!	My mother is a single mom, and we are very close. She and my father got divorced when I was three, and he moved to Los Angeles, CA. I am also close to my dad, and he and my mom remain friends. My mom is a freelance writer in advertising, and my dad is a technical engineer at a video production studio. He lives with his girlfriend, Stacy, and they are expecting their first child in May, so I am very excited to have a half sister! I did not have any siblings growing up, so I've always been fond of big families.	No	No	No	I have never lived without a parent outside of college, but I have certainly spent a lot of time without either of them in the house. I am definitely capable of cooking and caring for myself. I have also traveled a lot independently.	I am very excited to study art  in a city that is so rich with museums and creative resources! I also want to bring my command of the French language as close as possible to fluency, so I am able to understand the subtleties and colloquialisms of the language that are usually lost in translation. With a firmer grasp of French, I hope to increase my comprehension of French literature and film while understanding the roles language can play in plot development. I wish to be able to read French literature without as much of a need for a dictionary, and watch French films without the English subtitles.	I am primarily interested in Modern and Postmodern American literature and poetry, as well as French literature around the fin-de-siècle. I am also interested in French Impressionism, Modern and Contemporary art, film history, and politics of the mass media.	I am interested graphic design, illustration, and animation, and frequently design posters for events on campus through Vassar's music and entertainment organization. I also serve as a member of the student advisory committee to the art museum, where I frequently design posters and generate publicity for art center events. In my free time, I spend a lot of my time reading and watching movies with my friends. I also enjoy cooking and baking — I am very passionate and open-minded about good food!	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None	None — I am very open food-wise.	No	None, except for one specific medication called Terazole, which is a topical ointment.	I hope to feel comfortable and safe inside the home, and I am very interested in getting to know a host family that is fun to spend time with! I am also interested in the apartment's neighborhood and surrounding cultural vibrancy. I am open to living with a family with kids around my age, or a happily married couple who are both nice and interesting people. Perhaps a primary concern for me would be finding a happy medium between independence and loneliness — on the one hand, I want to be able to find some alone time when I need it; but on the other hand, I don't want to feel too lonely! I would be open to living with a family with children as long as they are are not too overwhelming.			Like I said before, I enjoy spending time with children as long as I am able to find alone time when necessary. I am open to living with animals, but not too many! It would be great if my host family was interested in art, or literature, or both. I am not extremely neat but I tidy up my space very often and prefer cleanliness. At the earliest, I go to bed around midnight but I can be very quiet. Thank you!
Guy	Mireille	Yes	Yes		Yes- as a dual citizen with France I have had the opportunity to travel to France almost every year to visit family. Trips lasted between two weeks to a month, and I stayed mostly in Paris but travelled around the country.	Yes, in high school I stayed with a family in Carcassonne for a week. It was a great experience, though as it was only a week I never had the opportunity to get the know my host family very well. Furthermore, I was living outside of the city itself and I found it a bit isolating. I really enjoyed learning about how the cultural family dynamics differed from my own, and I was lucky to have a host sister my age to connect with. Having someone around my age in the host family played a key factor in for me in having a positive home stay experience. In addition, my family hosted an exchange student from Spain in high school. What I learned from this was the importance of finding an equilibrium between making them feel at home/ comfortable and giving them their independence.	My family is very close- I like to spend time with my parents and siblings when I'm home, and I am close to my brother (22) who is a student in DC. I also have a younger sister (14). My parents work full time, my father is a hedge fund manager and mother is a doctor. We are all very independent, but usually come together for family dinner or the occasional movie.	No	No	No		I want to build more connections in a city I love, and I was to explore the city and its culture in more depth. I think that by studying there, as well as having a home stay and meeting more locals I will accomplish this as well as improve my French.	I am a Sociology/Anthropology major, and I really like learning how to look at different areas of academics through this lens- looking especially at the theoretical aspects. I also like current affairs, history, and political science.	In my spare time I enjoy running outside, going to art museums, and writing (I write for my school's newspaper). I also enjoy travelling, spending time outside in general, and trying new foods.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Yes			Yes	no	It is important to me that I feel comfortable my neighborhood and that, if I have to commute early in the morning or late in the evening that I feel safe and do not have to travel too far.			
Hirsch	Rachel		Yes		Traveled to and lived in Taiwan over the course of a couple of summers - Traveled to Canada and Mexico	No	Dad, younger sister	No	Yes	No		To improve my French and learn in a different environment	Art history	Swimming, reading, exploring, learning, art, going out with friends	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	ibuprofen		No	cats and dogs; ibuprofen	I don't have very many concerns--I'd just like to live in a happy and healthy environment			
Huang	Zhuofan	No	Yes		I've never traveled to France. I'm an international student from China and I've been living in the U.S. for two years.	N/A	I don't have any siblings. My father works as a civil servant and my mother is a high school teacher.	No	No	No	N/A	To study French and French art. Also I'd love to stay in a large city because there are plentiful museums, cinemas, restaurants, etc.	I'm an art history and French double major.	Visiting museums and studying different languages.

Kim	Alice	Yes	Yes	N/A	I have traveled to France twice, for a total of about three weeks. I visited Paris, Aquitaine, Cannes, Nice and also did a battlefields tour of the country! I also love, love traveling and have been all over the world, covering six continents!	N/A	My parents have both been retired for the last decade or so, but before that, my father was a CEO of a shipping company in Korea (he sold it when we moved to Canada) and my mother was an art teacher. My brother is two years younger than me and I also have a miniature poodle (hypoallergenic).	No	Yes	Yes	Having had a really horrible roommate situation this semester, I would really appreciate a single as I have realized that I'm someone who needs a lot of personal space/time in order to recharge myself. But that does not mean that I am not social! I love to try out new cuisine and to cook for myself and others - at Swarthmore, I often invite friends over to my dorm to have dinner parties!	Improve my French skills, broaden my horizons, become more independent, opportunity to live in one of my most favorite cities in the world, explore, make lasting relationships, explore, live la vie parisienne!	I am double majoring in French & Francophone Studies and English Literature, but am very, very open to exploring new subject areas of study (just not in natural sciences). I want to explore art history and archaeology while in Paris. At Swarthmore, I have only been exposed to theory-based education, but I would like to branch out into a more hands on, experiential type of learning.	Extra-curriculars: Editor at the school newspaper, horsebackriding, tutor at CACDC, HAN (korean cultural group), circ assistant at the library -  - Activities: boating, fishing, going out with friends, exploring, trying out new cuisines, traveling, reading, watching movies	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Tomatoes (raw, whole form) make me feel really sick. But I can eat tomato sauce, ketchup, etc.	None	No	Allergies to animal fur, house dust. Would prefer a non-carpeted room. I vacuum/Swiffer/dust my room regularly!	I want to find the perfect family with whom I can bond and form a solid relationship with! -  - Other than that, it would be wonderful if I could live in the heart of the city, as I'm not very map savvy.			I'm a light sleeper, so I would appreciate little/no noise between about 1 am and whenever I need to wake up. I like to study in my room a lot, but I'm guessing that will change once I'm in Paris! I need a lot of sleep so I will occasionally nap and sleep in really late on weekends.  -  - I would enjoy living with children, but that's not of the utmost importance to me.  -  - Thank you!
Kourdova	Kalina	No	Yes		I had the opportunity to stay in Paris for three weeks on a summer school program after my sophomore year in high school. Last summer, I spent a week in Beijing and another 7 weeks in Qingdao,China, on an intensive language program. Currently, I am an international student in the United States.	While in Qingdao this summer, I had a home stay for a week with a Chinese family. I really enjoyed the short time I spent with my host family because it was an unusual and very interesting cultural experience. I learned a lot about the Chinese traditional cuisine and about their habits. However, the communication was problematic sometimes because I was only a second-year student in Chinese, and they almost did not speak English.	The family consisted of two parents and a five-year-old girl. The father was working in the software industry. Since he could work from home, he was spending more time with me and his daughter, while the mother was working in an international company, so she was coming home much later.	No	Yes	No	Due to the short length of this experience, I do not think it significantly influenced my current preferences in housing in Paris.	My three-week stay in Paris left me with great memories and made me very passionate about the French culture. I loved the dynamic life in the capital, the great diversity of cultural events, the history, the art, the museums and the fact that there were countless opportunities around me. The main reason for coming to Paris is to immerse myself in the French culture and to learn more about all aspects of it. I will also aim to gain fluency in the language and to take full advantage of the European university experience. I'm considering doing an internship or even trying to find a job in France in the future.	My main academic interests are related to Economics. I'm particularly interested in public policy but also in international trade and in the way financial markets work. I'm also interested in mathematics.	I'm a pianist and I'm passionate about music in general. I also consider myself an outgoing person and I like to meet new people, explore new places and meet with friends outside home. At Vassar, I work for the Office of International Services, where I, along with the other interns, am responsible for the organization of events that bring the international community together. I really enjoy planning events that bring people together.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None.	None.	No	No.	One of my principal concerns is related to the location of the home where I will live. I would prefer to be closer to the central part rather than in a place in the outskirts or in one of the more isolated quarters of the city. Another concern I have is related to the level of noise in the household. I would like to live with a family with no children or children in their 20s but possibly not younger than that because I believe that it will be distracting for me.			I need a relatively quiet sleeping environment because I wake up easily from noise.
Liang	Lei		Yes		I'm an international student from China. I have been studying in US for 3 years (including one year of high school)	I did an exchange program and was hosted by a family in Oklahoma for one year. I enjoyed the experience and I learned a lot, but there were a lot of conflicts between the family members, especially between the 16 years old son and the mother, which made me feel really uncomfortable. So I would prefer the household to have no teenager	I'm the only child. Both my parents are engineers	Yes	No	Yes	I'm Ok with cooking my own, but I hope my host could be someone who enjoys cooking with the student.	I have been always interested in French cinema, especially French cinema. I'm planing to take two or three cinema study courses in the university. I'm planning to do my graduate study in France, so I want to familiarize myself with Paris. Another very important reason is that I really want to be in an exciting city after two years of Vassar.	Film, French, German	I'm crazy about films, especially foreign or independent films. If there are some clubs for student filmmakers in Paris, I'd love to join. I'm also interested in theater and opera. I'm taking Jazz piano right now. I'm not very good, but I hope to keep on practicing in Paris.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes			No		interaction with the host. I hope to be hosted by someone who enjoys spending time with the student			I'm not good with children, so I hope my host doesn't have any kid in the house. About neatness, I'm quite laid back and sometime organized, so we might run into problems if my host can't stand messiness. I generally sleep before midnight during weekdays
Mooney	Grace	No			I spent 2.5 weeks in France with my school, including a 1 week family stay, the summer after my Junior year of high school. I have also spent 2 weeks in France with my parents.	I spent a week in a family stay in France when I was 16. I also hosted an exchange student in high school. My main impression of this was that it is up to the exchange student to reach out and experience everything that is available-as well as being friendly and making relationships with their hosts.	I have two moms, and one brother. One of my moms is an Outreach Specialist and the University of Wisconsin, and the other is the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Experiential Learning, and the director of Center for Patient Partnership (a non profit organization). My brother is currently a senior at Vassar, and is studying English. I also have a Dad, and his wife, who are both retired, and their two children, my half sister and half brother. In addition to that, my brother's biological fathers are artists.	No	No	No		I want to experience living in Paris-not just stopping by as a tourist. I would love to explore the city, and have an experience of French life. I want to become fluent in French, and I want to experience everything that the city has to offer-especially seeing the art and eating the food. I am a big 'foodie', and am really excited to explore what Paris has to offer as far as food goes. I am also an Art History major, and I can't wait to spend some time exploring the Louvre, wandering through cathedrals, and just generally having a chance to see things in person that I've only studied from images so far.	I am an Art History and Religion double major, with an interest in American Art.	I love food; I am on Food Committee at Vassar (a committee of students who speak to administration about food issues on campus), and I have also instituted a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) share of produce for students to buy through the Vassar Food Cooperative. I am very interested in cheese production, and have worked on multiple cheese farms and in a specialty cheese and foods store. I am also very active-I love to row, and hope to join a crew team/club while I'm in Paris. I love to spend time outside, hiking or biking or swimming. I am also a big reader, and read a lot in my free time.	Occasional smoker	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	I have extremely sensitive skin, which I control mostly through diet and exercise; therefore, I have to eat a diet high in protein and vegetables and low in sugar and carbohydrates. I would not be able to eat the breakfast that is laid out in the housing information form; I usually eat eggs, oatmeal, veggie sausage, etc for breakfast, and I can't drink fruit juice, eat jam, or eat much bread/cereal at all.		Yes	I am slightly allergic to cats.	I am concerned about food-I have specific dietary needs, and I would like access to healthy foods. I am also concerned about my host family knowing that I have lesbian moms-I don't want to feel uncomfortable with my background in the home. One of my high priorities is also living towards the center of the city, if possible, rather than on the outskirts.			I would not want to live in a house with pets. I love children-I have been babysitting for years, and love to play with kids. I usually study during the day, and usually away from my dorm room (however, my study habits may change when I'm in a different place). I am relatively neat, although I definitely will let my room get messy sometimes when I'm particularly busy. I am mostly pretty quiet, and I think I'm a respectful person to share a living space with. I would really love to be able to cook with my host family, because I am very interested in food and I love learning new recipes from people. I have a few specific things that I need for my skin, and right now I sleep with a humidifier on in my room; I may not buy one while I'm in France, but if I am having skin troubles I might need to have one.
Nakagawa	Erika	Yes	Yes		I have lived in France from 2000 to 2002 in Strasbourg.  Then, I revisited France in 2003 for about a month.  I have also traveled to Japan for about two months last summer on my own.	Last summer, I took part in a home stay program on farms in Japan and made everlasting memories.  From this experience, I have learned that my Japanese language skills drastically improved and I was glad to have the opportunity to interact with local people.  However, since I stayed with two different home stay families, I realized that I felt more comfortable when the family was bigger and there were more younger kids.  In fact, I really enjoyed playing with the kids and I think the parents really appreciated my enthusiasm.  In fact, the loud and lively atmosphere really made me feel more at ease and I felt like I truly belonged to the family.  Therefore, if possible, I would probably like to be with a family that has young children, or even just pets.	My family is pretty lively.  My parents often like to joke around, we sometimes eat out together, and yet they're very busy driving my brother to his sports practices and games. My mother is a busy homemaker and my father is an aeronautical engineer who comes home from work around 7PM.   Meanwhile, as a freshman in high school (15 years old), my brother has been slowly developing into a teenager and he likes to talk about music a lot.  Nevertheless, we still have a lot of fun acting child-like around each other and just being ridiculous.  To top it all off, my dog is really loud and playful and he always barks at the slightest suspicion of an intruder.  Even though he is old, he doesn't seem to show his age at all and is great company when my parents are out taking my brother to his basketball or volleyball practices.	No	No	No	Since I haven't had much experience living independently in a non-dorm setting, I do feel a little apprehensive about cooking for myself.  However, I am determined to learn.	I would like to improve my french language skills, create connections in the city in hopes of maybe attending graduate school here, and learn more about the french culture so that I could contextualize all that I have learned at Vassar College.	As a major in Sociology and French, I am particularly interested in the way French art, literature, and other forms of culture affect the society.  In fact, I would like to study french literature in greater depth.	I love to read, sing jazz, write, and go hiking.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	I am allergic to crab.	None.	Yes	No allergies.	I would like to know if there will be any curfews since I don't know how late I may be out on some evenings.  I would also like to ask about WIFI in houses and whether I would be able to use the internet while I am in my room using my own laptop.			I love children and animals.  While I am not as neat as my mother, I do also like to clean up every once in a while.  At Vassar, I tend to study at night until midnight and then sleep around 1AM but I am willing to change my schedule a bit to accommodate my host family's.  However, I do wonder whether there will be a curfew since I don't know when I would be coming back at night if I do go out with friends--especially on the weekends. While I do like to occasionally play music at a moderate volume, I am willing to use headphones at all time.  Likewise, I like to study in silence.
Owen-Dunow	Max	Yes	Yes		I've traveled for brief stretches in France (10 days in Paris), Italy, England, and Spain. I've never lived in a foreign country.	No.	I grew up living with my mother, father, and twin sister. My mother is a social worker, my father a literary agent, and my sister a student.	No	No	No	N/A	I'm motivated to come to Paris for two principal reasons. Firstly, I think I have much to gain academically from spending a semester in Paris. Beyond being academically interested in French language, literature, and culture, I am also interested in political science, and lately, specifically in the politics of Europe. Secondly, and more importantly, I want to study in Paris because I believe it will be a transformative experience outside of the classroom as well. I'm motivated by the chance to immerse myself in another culture, to experience a new city, and to pursue my studies in a real-world setting.	I'm a double major in Government (with a concentration in comparative politics) and French studies. I intend to pursue the certificate in international relations.	I play co-ed club ultimate frisbee here at Wesleyan and am also interested in theater and music. I'm heavily involved on campus in a program that offers free SAT tutoring and college counseling to underserved local high school students.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes					I don't know that I have any major concerns about housing, beyond nerves about getting used to French domestic life!			I'd love to have a housing arrangement where my hosts had a child close to my age, though I'm certainly not against the idea of living with a single host. I'd appreciate living somewhere close to other students on the VWPP. I'm more than happy to live with animals. I'd appreciate at least some access to a kitchen. Having private, quiet, personal space is important to me.
Scher	Gabrielle	Yes	Yes		I have traveled to France, Mexico, Australia, Malawi, South Africa, Singapore and London.  I was in France for 6 days, Mexico for a week, Australia for 10 days, Malawi for 2 weeks, South Africa for a day, Singapore for 3 days and London for a week.	I have lived with a host family before.  This was when I went to Malawi, Africa with a program called BuildOn, where we helped build a school.  I traveled with a group of 18 students and we were all divided among a bunch of host families in a rural village in a way that we each had one to two roommates from the program.  I ended up being put into a host family with two roommates from the program.  These host families spoke chichewa, and while we learned a few words and short expressions such as "My name is", speaking was not really our main form of communication.  We mostly ended up using our hands and making motions to communicate.  Some of my host siblings spoke a little bit of english, but again, this was not really our main form of communication. -  - As for how this influences my preferences in housing in Paris, I think the experience will be quite different, since I'll actually be able to speak the same language as my host family, but I think that I really enjoyed having a host family with kids, especially some around my own age, so that would be nice to have in Paris too.	My mom is a trademark attorney, who is currently self employed but looking for a job.  My sister is a senior in high school, and she'll be turning 18 towards the end of this month.  My father was a CFO of a sportswear company but due to complicated circumstances he was fired and is currently unemployed.   Due to this circumstance, my parents have recently gotten divorced and I live with my mother.  I also have two dogs and have had at least one dog in the house throughout my entire life.	No	No	No	N/A	I really want to become fluent, or as close to fluent as possible, in french.  I've been studying the language since around 2nd grade, or age 8 and I have always really enjoyed learning about it.  At this point in my french education, I feel like I've reached a certain level and am slightly blocked from advancing and the only way to remedy that is to completely immerse myself in the language itself.  Also one of my majors is french and going abroad to france is a really important part of the major.	I'm very interested in math, biology and french.	At Vassar I am part of an a cappella group that sings all disney songs, I am one of the captains on the quidditch team (the sport from the Harry Potter books) and I am a student fellow, which is essentially like an RA at other colleges in that I help the freshmen with any problems they might be having and help them get adjusted to college.  I also used to take piano lessons and really enjoy playing the piano.	No	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	N/A	I am jewish, so on Yom Kippur, I will be fasting until sundown.  Even though I am jewish, I do not keep kosher.	Yes	Not that I am aware of.	I think trying to budget my meals will be a bit of a challenge, at least at first, since I've never had to buy groceries or cook for myself before.  Yet, I think once I establish a schedule it should be manageable.  As for a priority and I think communication with my host family is extremely important and will probably be the key to a positive chambre dans un appartement experience.  So, I will definitely make sure to find out how things work in their apartment and what their rules are and then work my living situation around that.			I would really love to be placed with a family that has a dog, if possible.  I would also like a family with children, but if that's not possible, I'd prefer a house with a dog.  As for interests, I don't have to be placed with a family that has the exact same interests as me cause I find it interesting to learn about different interests, but I'd prefer not to be placed with a family that extremely interested in politics.  I'm generally a neat person, but I'm not the type of person where everything has to be perfect and people can't touch myself, so I think a family that is organized and somewhat neat, but not overly concerned with neatness.  I like to study in my room or the library, so as long as I have a quiet space where I can either listen to music out of my computer or using headphones that will be fine.  I also sometimes sing while I do my work.  I don't mind noise as long as there is quiet when I'm going to sleep.  I generally go to sleep when I finish my work, so anywhere between 12-2 on a typical night.
Schieferstein	Daria	Yes			I traveled to France in 2009 and stayed for three weeks. - I have also spent shorter amounts of time in Italy, Germany, Austria and Hungary. - I traveled with my high school to Kenya and Peru, staying in both places for three weeks. - I have also been to Ecuador and China.	No I have not experienced a home stay experience of hosted an international student.	I am an only child and live with my parents who are still married. - My mother is a landscape designer and my father is an architect, both through their own businesses.	Yes	Yes	No	I am very independent and adaptive.  I could live with a family that is present or one that travels and is not always around.  I prefer to have the most freedom possible.	My principal reasons for coming to Paris are to immerse and live in a new city, improve my french language speaking skills, experience traveling, spending time and meeting new people from Vassar/Wesleyan as well as from France.	Aside from studying the french language my main academic interest is political science which is my second major.  I am also very interseted in created writing and literature.	I play tennis and do yoga.  - I  love photography and creative writing.	Occasional smoker	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes			Yes	I do not have any allergies.	My principal concern regarding housing is that I will not be able to communicate with my family.			I prefer not to be around young children and rather children closer to my age.   - I love all animals! - My study habits are dependent on class schedule but usually do not work late into the night- I stop around midnight.  - I usually go to sleep anywhere between 12:45-2:30 am but can sleep through most things and do not care about noise. - I am a pretty neat person.
Shajrawi	Ali		Yes		I have never lived in France. I lived in England for a month, India for 3 weeks.	I have never had a home stay experience with a foreign family but I think this would be a opportunity to practice my french more and get to meet more people.	I grew up in a family of 7 members including my parents and myself. I'm the youngest among my siblings. I have three sisters and one brother and they all are married. My father is a retired army officer, and my mother is a retired school teacher. My brother lives and works in Belgium. One of my sisters live in New York City, the other one lives in Jordan while the last one lives in Saudi.	Yes	No	Yes	I lived in an apartment in England independently with no roommates. I used to cook once to twice a day. I loved having my own space which allowed me to form it and arrange it the way best suited me. I always had friends over for lunch or dinner. This housing situation is good  for me as I had a very positive experience overall, but I don't mind living with a family in Paris.	I have many reasons for coming to Paris. A principal one is that I want to practice and learn French as French is my second major. I'm also fond of the French culture, mainly French philosophy and literature. I want to be living in the city where most great writers that I like lived in. This would help me understand and contextualize their writings in a more inclusive way.	Academically, I'm interested in social studies (government, economics, philosophy, and history). I also love languages and the study of philosophical writing in their original texts.	I play rugby and squash. I like to read a lot and watch documentaries. Jogging. Watch sports.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	None	None	No	None				My sleeping habits are irregular. I usually stay late up at night and sleep for few hours in the morning. I do most of my work at night, which means that I keep lights on. Neatness is very important to me. My place has to be very neat for me to do work effectively and live contentedly. I prefer not to live in a place with animals. I would like to be living in the center of Paris, somewhere in arr 6eme, 7eme ou 8eme.
Steele	Elena	Yes	Yes		I have never traveled or lived in France or any other foreign country.	I have never had a home stay experience with a foreign family or hosted an international student.	I live with my mother and my 16-year old sister. My mother is a senior case assistant and takes care of both me and my sister. She has received her Master's degree and now takes classes at a local community college until she decides where she wants to go from here. My sister is a junior in high school.	No	No	No		I have never left the United States so I want to experience what it is like to be completely submerged in a foreign country and its culture. It is also a way for me to get out of my comfort zone because I won't necessarily be surrounded by other English speakers or people who have had similar life experiences to me.	I am an International Studies major and I am very interested in EU government as well as learning more about France's colonial history.	In my leisure time, I watch a lot of movies and television shows, American and foreign. I am a member of the Vassar Democrats and I participated in the Transitions program ( a pre-orientation program for low income and first generation students) in my freshman year and still attend some of the get-togethers.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	I am allergic to all tree nuts. Just eating a little bit can make my throat swell up.		Yes	I am not allergic to anything else.	I am an introvert and enjoy having a little bit of alone time occasionally. I definitely don't want to be alone all of the time and would enjoy having dinners with my host family. But having time to be alone in a quiet setting maybe listening to music is important for me. I think sometimes my behavior may come off as rude so I would like someone who understands that it's just the way my brain works and does not think I am being rude or stand-offish.			I would prefer that my host family have a neat home. I would prefer that my host family not have young children but I am definitely ok with older teenagers (15-18 years old). Since I was three years old, I have only lived with my mother and sister so I am not really comfortable living around men. I would like a fairly quiet environment (meaning no loud music at 2 in the morning). I may stay up late in my room studying or watching television so someone who would not have a problem with that would be great. I am not allergic to pets but I have been afraid of most animals (really anything except fish) since I was a child. Living in a home with any animal that is not a fish would make me very uncomfortable.
Thorne	Evan	Yes	Yes		I have never been to France, but I have traveled to several other foreign countries. With my family I visited Bermuda, the Bahamas, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, and Canada. Each of these trips lasted a little over a week. Without my family, on a sponsored trip for Jewish teens, I visited Israel for a little over two weeks.	When in Israel I stayed with a host family for one night. My host family resembled my actual family quite a bit, so I was able to easily see the differences between the two cultures, while also being able to compare all the similarities. Based on this experience, I hope to live with a family in Paris that resembles my family from home. This is because I would be more comfortable and familiar with their family structure, which would help me understand how French culture influences a family.	I have 3 siblings: Dean, Wesley, and Monica. Dean is 25 and is an account executive at a Boston radio station. Wesley is my twin (age 18) and is a studying Biology at Boston College. Monica is 17 and still in high school. My father, William (age 57), is president and owner of a software company, called Inventu, and is still married to my mother, Susan (age 55), who works for Inventu as well. Last but not least I have a Portuguese Water Dog named Brewster, who is just as much a part of the family as everyone else.	No	No	No	Never having lived independently, I fear that living alone or with only one other individual in an entirely new city, with a new language and different culture, would be a lot to take in. For this reason, I certainly want to live with a family while in Paris.	I want to become fluent in French, while learning about French culture and experiencing what life is like in a big European city.	Math, Computer Science, Psychology, and foreign languages.	Since I have a very time-consuming job on campus I don't find myself with much time to pursue many extra-curricular activities. However, that being said, I do play trumpet in the pep band and participate weekly in French Conversation hours. In my free time I enjoy watching movies with friends and attending concerts or events on campus.	No	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None	None to note.	No	No.	To live with a family with children who live in the house, and in a region of Paris close to several attractions, parks, or areas to shop/walk.			I definitely want my host family to have children that still live in the house (and I'm great with young kids, so their age doesn't entirely matter to me). I would also love it if my host family had a dog (or other animal), as I am a huge dog person. However, I understand that this type of family is rarely found in Paris and I would thus prefer children over a dog. I am very neat and organized so I would hope my host family would be too, although once again I care more about them having kids and pets. I would really like to live in a region of Paris close to attractions such as the Eiffel Tower, shopping districts, or parks, as I want to be able to travel to a variety of different locations on foot, while seeing as much as Paris as possible. I am very interested in the arts, music, and in cinema, so I would definitely get along well with a family that shares similar interests.
Wallach	Sophia	Yes	Yes		I have never lived in a foreign country before.  The only places I have traveled are Cuba, Israel, and Australia for a two weeks at a time.	No I have not.	Both my parents are academics.  My dad is a professor of political science and my mom used to be a professor of international studies until she joined the administration of the college instead. They are 60 years old yet still very athletic.  My dad runs 9 miles 4 times a week!  My younger brother is 18 and loves music and karate.  He has an entire room devoted to his guitar/piano/amp set up. He is just graduating from high school and wants to pursue mechanical engineering as his field of study.	Yes	Yes	Yes	I truly enjoy having a sense of independence and living on my own has made me appreciate what it means to answer just to yourself. However, I love having roommates or people in general to live with.  In college, instead of living in a single I chose to live with friends because I always want the company of others near by. Living with a host family will give me the stability of having a place to return to that I can consider a home, while still providing me the luxury of independence which is essential to appreciating an abroad experience.	I want to speak french fluently.  I also want to experience what its like to live in another culture and truly immerse myself in it.	I am very interested in political science and history.  However I am also interested in economics as well as psychology-- how and why humans react with one another from two different perspectives.	I love music.  I've played violin for over 10 years and have done various other types of music in bands, in an orchestra, solo etc. throughout my life. It's a huge part of it and is one that I wish to continue while in france.  In addition I play a lot of sports.  I've played tennis since elementary school but I also did soccer and crew for many years.  Right now I like to run. Other than that spending time with friends and really getting to know the people I'm with and the place I'm in are the most important. Meeting new people and just hanging out are perhaps my favorite things to do no matter what.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	N/A	I am very open to trying different kinds of foods.	No	I am very allergic to dogs and slightly allergic to cats though not nearly as much.	That I am placed with someone who will be willing to have a relationship with me and help me adjust but will also allow for space.  I would like to be with someone who will be a rock of sorts, though only really when necessary.  For the most part, I am a very independent person.			I don't mind if there are children at all. I am a relatively tidy person, however by no means is my room clean at all times.  I like to wake up at 8am (depending on schedule) and go to bed around 1 for a weekday. Study habits are totally dependent on the situation though I prefer to work alone either in the library or my room.  I do like working with people, however I am easily distracted by others and good conversation.
Wilton	Rebecca	No	Yes		I've been to France twice, for a total time period of about 12 days. Both times were very short trips moving around a lot. I've lived in Kenya for 5 weeks, and I've also been to Eastern Europe and Israel for a total of 6 weeks.	No.	I have two parents, married - my father is South African and my mother is from Kentucky. My father is a surgeon and my mother has her own floral design business.  I have an older sister who is 28, lives in LA, works in fashion marketing. I have a younger sister who is 18 and will be at Lewis and Clark in the fall and a younger brother who is 16. We have a yellow lab named Wellington.	Yes	Yes	Yes	I live in Farm House right now with 14 other people - mostly it just means that I'm used to things not being clean all the time and having to share a lot. I like living with other people, but since I have a roommate this year I get a little less alone time than I would prefer. That's okay though, she rocks. I'm used to living in all kinds of different housing styles and am very adaptable.	It's been my life long dream - I've been a francophile since elementary school and studying in Paris is the culmination of my destiny. I love everything French and Paris is the best city in the world.	I study Art History and Romance Language Studies. I'm passionate about history and learning about global cultures. I study Italian in addition to French and it's my dream to master all the Romance Languages including Latin and Romanian. I love theater, film, art, literature.... Anything that gives me a window into another culture.	I run a student group called WesFRESH dedicated to food culture and food sustainability at Wesleyan. We work with the dining hall, hold community meals, screen films, etc. I love eating and take pleasure in trying new foods. I also sing in Ebony Singers, the gospel choir on campus; I'm Jewish but non-practicing.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None.	None.	No	No.	I want to be in the center of Paris and with people who are passionate about culture/cultural activities as much as I am.			It would be a plus if the family had a cat but it's not necessary.
