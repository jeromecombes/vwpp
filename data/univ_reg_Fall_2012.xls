Andrews	Charlotte	French & Francophone Studies	Political Science		English	2nd	3rd	1st	4th	5th	I believe Paris 7 would fit my interests because I have a focus in the social sciences, particularly Political Science.  I cannot take courses at IEP because my program is too short for it.  I would love to take a political science, anthropology, or sociology course at Paris 7, all of which I am prepared to take a Licence 2 level course for.  There seem to be a wide range of subjects covered in the Paris 7 curriculum that fit many of my interests.  My second choice is Paris 3 because I am also focusing in Literature.  Paris 3 would be great for my interests in literature and history.  The experiences would be different, but both Paris 7 and Paris 3 would offer highly beneficial experience to my studies at Vassar.  I am unsure of the exact courses offered at both institutions, so I do not know which would cater to my intellectual focuses the best.

Bjornson	Julius	French Studies	German Studies (Full Major)	Music		2nd	1st	3rd			As a triple major in French, German and Music, I will only be able to take courses relevant to all three at Paris 4. Furthermore, ISHA at Paris 4 has a linguistics program, which I am determined to incorporate into my study. Neither Paris 3 nor 7 has such a comprehensive array of courses I need. I have chosen Paris 3 as a second best: it lacks music, meaning I do not see it as a good option, but still affords me access to a significant number of courses related to linguistics and German studies.

Carr	Margaret	History	Art History			2nd	1st	3rd	4th		Paris 4 is my first choice because I really want to be able to take art history classes while in Paris. I love art, and the opportunity to study art while in a city so rich with beautiful museums and architecture would be absolutely amazing. Paris 4 is also appealing to me for its many interesting looking history courses. I would love to take a class in French history in a French university. Paris 3 appeals to me for its courses in French literature. I would also be interested in taking classes within the different "studies" programs that Paris 3 offers. I am very sorry that I filled this form out late, with the stress of finals it completely slipped my mind.

Conrad	Caroline	les études cinématographiques		la psychologie		1st	2nd	4th	3rd	5th	J'étudie principalement le film et la psychologie, et je voudrais prendre les cours dans ces services. Je m'interesse aussi à la sociologie, l'anthropologie, et le literature, et je pense que les cours qui mieux les correspondent sont en Paris 3 et 4 pour la plupart. Je voudrais mieux comprendre le relationship entre la culture Français et comment les films la reflétent.

Edwards	Ian	International Studies	Arabic	German	International Economics	5th	2nd	1st	3rd	5th	I'm really torn between Paris 4 and Paris 7. My senior thesis for international studies will be on some topic of Arabic immigration into France and Germany, and while Paris 7 has an excellent range of classes in the economics department that may relate to this, the humanities component of Paris 4 with its rich language repertoire is very attractive. If there would happen to be an econ department or econ offerings (mainly concerning the topic of immigration or globalization), it would be an easy decision for Paris 4 which is exactly the type of Latin Quarter Parisian education I've dreamed of. As it stands, I'm leaving the choice up to the best judgment of the program and the difference in ranking between choice 1 and 2 is insignificant.     (I'm also incredibly sorry for the late submission---I was under the impression this was due on the 20th--thanks for being flexible!)	Paris 7	High School Diploma --Mt.

Ellman	Hannah	American Culture (History, Native American Studies)	Secondary Level Certification in Social Studies			3rd	2nd	1st	4th	5th	Paris 7 has the most courses available that are applicable to my American Culture Major studies at Vassar and the comparative cultural studies requirement that I plan to fill while I'm abroad. I am looking to have the opportunity to study European History or perhaps Geography, as a means to gain a new perspective in regards to my Social Studies teaching certification, and Paris 7 offers courses in the areas that I am interested in. Paris 4 is my second choice for similar reasons, as their method for approaching History is also of interest to me.

Garrick-Okoli	Isabelle	Psychology				2nd	5th	1st	4th	3rd	Paris VII has the largest selection of courses and there are a quite a few of interest to me. Paris III is a backup plan but I think that film classes would be a great way to familiarize myself with french culture.

Ichizawa	Maria	French and Francophone Studies	Japanese	Asian Studies		3rd	4th	1st	5th	2nd	Taking a Japanese language course is very important to me, and I also hope to take an Asian studies course in french. Therefore, I hope to study at Paris 7, which offers courses most relevant to my Asian Studies Major. I know that SciencePo also offers Japanese classes, at the le Havre Campus. However, I would prefer the Paris 7 University.

Lee	Vera	Economics	Art History (not yet declared)	French			3rd	2nd		1st	Since I am an Economics major, I would like to study at Sciences Po and Paris 7, which offer the most courses related to my major.  Additionally, since I plan to be fully enrolled at Sciences Po in the spring semester, taking courses to familiarize myself with their classes and system would be very helpful, which is why I've listed Sciences Po ahead of Paris 7.

Lopez	Sydney	Media Studies				3rd	2nd	1st		4th	I chose Paris VII as my first choice because I am interested in the multidisciplinary nature of the University. Paris IV is my second choice because it has the options of international studies other areas of study that aren't directly related to my major but I am interested in nonetheless, such as art history and geography.

Madwed	Isaac	French		Studio Art		4th	1st	2nd	3rd		I would most like to attend Paris 4 or Paris 7 because they offer courses in the arts and in art history.  I am planning on double majoring in French and Studio Art and would love to be able to get some of my credits out of the way for my non-French major, while studying something I truly enjoy in France.

Morgan	Anya	French		English		1st	3rd	2nd	4th	5th	I would like to go to Paris 3 because my main focus is literature, and I am also interested by film.  Paris 7 is my second choice because it has the widest range of subjects, so I could definitely find something I'm interested in, but it is less centrally located than 3 (or so I've heard).

Myerberg	Nicholas	Awaiting decision on a university major in social, cultural, and critical theory				4th	3rd	2nd	1st		My first choice, CIPh, is most pertinent to my academic interests. I'm excited to take courses with some of the thinkers I've most enjoyed reading—the prospect of attending some of Hélène Cixous' lectures is particularly exciting not only because she is a big name, but also because the reading lists from some of her past courses are so compelling. Her seminar this past semester included Proust, Poe, Dostoyevsky, Derrida, and Genet, among others. To hear someone—especially someone like Cixous—lecture on these great thinkers would be a fantastic chance to expand my understanding of theory and literature alike.     I've chosen Paris 7 as my second choice because it has been recommended to me by Prof. Poisson—I trust her judgment on this matter, though I know very little about the university.

Peterson-Cochrane	Chloe	Anthropology		French		2nd	3rd	1st			I am an anthropology student, and would therefore love to take classes in the social sciences. However, I am also very interested in Francophone literature and cinema, which are the subjects of many of the courses at Paris III.

Ripecky	Zoe	International Studies				2nd	3rd	1st	4th	5th	I am interested in having a choice of a variety of courses and I think these two universities would provide the most diverse array in the subjects I'm interested in. While abroad I would consider taking classes in the subjects of Political Science, Sociology, Economics, and Art History.

Scriptunas	Tess	English		French		2nd	3rd	1st	4th	5th	I would prefer to register with Paris 7, because it offers the widest variety of courses and I think that I have the best chance of finding a good English course there.  I would also like to have a range of choices in what I take as my second elective, so I like the fact that it offers classes in a variety of disciplines.  I put Paris 3 as my second choice because it specializes in Literature, which would be useful at the very least for my French major and possibly for my English major.

Sears	Anna	government	international relations certificate		middle eastern studies certificate	2nd	1st	3rd	4th		I am interested in Paris 4 because I find its international/intercultural studies program to be very interesting and relevant to my course of study at Wesleyan. I like the emphasis on learning another foreign language, which interests me because I study hebrew and israeli relations. They have a very interesting European studies program as well as interdisciplinary programs for things like Latin-american studies and Iranian studies. My interest in government and international relations comes a lot from learning about how cultures form and interact, which I feel like is similar to the program at Paris 4.     I also feel like Paris 3 would be a good fit for me for similar reasons. I like their history program as well as their European studies program, both of which dovetail a lot with the things I am interested in at Wesleyan. Both of these universities combine research and cultural study in a way that is very complimentary to the study of government and international relations. I am interested in Paris 3 because it has a very broad range of historical/contemporary sociology courses that have a political focus, which I think is a very cool way to approach the subject.
