Bird	Emma	Urban Studies	Art History		French (planning on declaring this week)	3rd	2nd	1st	4th	5th	I am an Urban Studies major, so I would like to take humanities classes at Paris 7. My courses would likely be geography and maybe a history class.    However, if Paris 7 is not available, I could take classes at Paris 4 in the Art History department. There, I would focus on the architectural side of Urban Studies, as well as have courses for my Art History correlate.	I think my main motivation for taking classes at Paris 7 is because I am interested in the social sciences for my Urban Studies major.

Buxton	Nicholas	French				2nd	1st	4th	5th	3rd	One of the biggest factors in my decision to study with VWPP for the 2013-2014 academic year is that VWPP has a partnership with Paris 4. Long before I started searching for study abroad programs, I knew that Paris 4 was where I wanted to study and take courses. I desire to study at Paris 4 because the courses offered there will best fulfill my major requirements as a French major and because they interest me more than the courses offered at any other Parisian institution. As a French major specializing in French literature, the French and Comparative Literature Department at Paris 4 offers the literature courses that will best fulfill my French major requirements at Tufts. Also, I plan on declaring a minor in Music and, therefore, I really wish to take courses in the Music and Musicology Department at Paris 4. In addition to French literature, music is my biggest academic passion and I would really love to have the opportunity of taking some of the music theory and musicology courses offered at Paris 4. Finally, I am also really interested in taking Art History and Latin courses at Paris 4 as both of these subjects really interest me. Paris 4 is my first choice by far; I really hope I have the opportunity to take courses there. My second choice is Paris 3 because it has a General and Comparative Literature Department; however, the literature courses offered at Paris 4 interest me much more than those offered at Paris 3. Additionally, I wouldn’t be able to take music, art, or Latin courses at Paris 3 like I would be able to at Paris 4.     Thank you very much for taking my request into account.

Choi	Lily	Sociology				3rd	2nd	1st	5th	4th	My 1st choice is Paris 7 and Paris 4 because I need to take courses that count towards my major (Sociology). Paris 7 has very interesting sociology courses pertaining to gender, which I am very interested in (I also took Women's Studies last semester). Paris 4 also has a Sociology department, though I was not able to find a list of classes online.

Gregoline	Emma	English	Art History			2nd	1st	3rd	4th	5th	Paris 4 is my first choice because of its academic offerings in art history. I am pursuing a correlate in art history, and I have only taken two out of the six course requirements so far at Vassar because I have been saving my credits to be taken while I am in Paris. Right now, I am a representative on the Student Advisory Committee to the Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar, and I would love to continue working at a museum someday just to be surrounded by art. Studying art history was what I had in mind when I decided to go abroad in France because of the country's unique and rich cultural history. I am also an English major, so if I am not able to get into Paris 4, I would be happy to study modern French literature at Paris 3 (which would also count toward my major).	No - my choice is motivated solely by academic reasons.	Paris 3		2011	United States	Chicago	Illinois	Sophomore	English	2011	English	Art History	Non					
Guy	Mireille					3rd	1st	2nd	4th		What is exciting about Paris 4 is the interdisciplinary nature of the school and its course offerings-- coming from a liberal arts college, this is very important to me. As a sociology/anthropology major classes such as “Political Sociology” or “Economic Sociology” cater to interests in my major as well as in a more cross-departmental way as well. Other interdisciplinary classes in the school that interest me include those in the Philosophy/Sociology department and include courses that fit my academic interests such as “Philosophy: Communication”. I hope to meet other students, both international and French, who have similar interdisciplinary interests as me, and I feel that at Paris 4 I would get that opportunity. Paris 7 has similar qualities with courses such as “The Sociology of Inequalities” and courses on immigration policy. With course offerings in different departments as well as sociology classes, this university would also allow me to not only pursue further studies within my major but to apply it to other departments as well.

Hirsch	Rachel	Art History		French		5th	1st	2nd	3rd	4th	I'd like to study at Paris 4 because I'm an art history major, and the classes seem to correlate well with my interests. I think that it would be interesting to study French art in a French setting because this is an experience that I cannot have in an American university. Additionally, I'm interested in studying the art history of regions that were once under French colonial control, in order to gain a new perspective on those areas. I've read the work of many French art historians (most recently, I've read Oleg Grabar's "The Formation of Islamic Art") and am interested in learning more about what influenced them.

Kim	Alice	French & Francophone Studies		English Literature		2nd	1st			3rd	After my freshman year at Swarthmore College, one could say that I had effectively completed a major in "Introductory Studies" - that is, the paradox of choice was both a bane and a godsend in that I simply could not settle down on one subject of interest. However, after a whirlwind tour of the social sciences and the natural sciences department, I arrived back where I belonged, with a more acute certainty that I had found, or at least uncovered, a bit of my niche in this world.     Looking back at my college application, I had indicated "French and Francophone Studies" as my prospective major - how incongruous it must have seemed when I enrolled for FREN 001 - Introductory French upon arrival! To my defense, I had finished the highest level of French that the British Columbia government offers in my junior year in high school, and thought that it would serve me well to start anew at college to hone from the base. And since then, I have fallen hard for the French department at Swarthmore College, and for the language and the culture of the Francophone world - It was then that I turned to VWP to take my journey to the next level.     One of the reasons why I chose VWP is because not only is it one of the most prestigious programs in the country, but also because it offered me the chance to study at the Sorbonne. It has been a fantasy of mine to study at the University of Paris-Sorbonne (preferably) or the Sorbonne Nouvelle since forever - if my French had been good enough two years ago, I most undoubtedly would have applied directly!     The Paris-Sorbonne is the ideal place for me for other, more practical reasons as well. Its legendary arts, humanities and languages programs is exactly what I need to explore all my possibilities as a French and English double major (At this time, I am also considering switching English to a Comparative Literature major to be able to spend more time in the French department), and looking through the course catalogues of past years, there are simply too many to choose from! Being able to take classes at the best university in France would really propel my passion and zeal into something bigger than myself, a dreamlike manifestation of what I've been striving to find during my university years and throughout my life.     I am also planning on finding a publishing internship in Paris during the spring semester to explore the professional world in France. My postgraduate plans are not finalized, but I am interested in going to law school, and it would be my wildest aspiration to attend the Pantheon-Assas, which is in alliance with the Paris-Sorbonne. I am also considering going to graduate school for French in the states. This will all take more than a chunk of chutzpah and hard work, but I am enthusiastic to begin.    So please, please, please, say yes. How many times in your life do you get to grant another's most ardent wish?     Thank you.	Not particularly.

Kourdova	Kalina	Economics				4th	3rd	1st		2nd	The main reason for ranking Paris 7 and IEP as my first and my second choices is related to my academics. I'm majoring in Economics and pursuing a correlate in Mathematics. These two universities are the only ones that offers courses, the credits for which I will be able to transfer toward my major at Vassar. I was really impressed by the choice of Economics and Finance courses Paris 7. I'm also interested in taking a course in Computer Science and only the university that I indicated as my 1st choice offers a variety of options in the field of Informatics.

Mooney	Grace	Art History		Religion		3rd	1st	2nd	4th	5th	I would like to take classes in Art History and Religion while I'm in Paris, specifically Art History because I need to transfer the credits, and because I'd like to take Art History in such an art historically important place (I am an Art History and Religion Major). I am generally inclined more towards Humanities courses rather than Math and Science, also.

Owen-Dunow	Max	Government	International Relations	French		1st	4th	2nd	5th	3rd	I'm attracted to Paris 3 because of my academic interest in Government/Political Science. My sense, from looking through the course catalogues of the schools, is that Paris 3 has the widest set of offerings in the social sciences. I'm drawn to Paris 7 as a second choice both because I think I'd be able to find interesting courses to take there, and also because I like its broader, "liberal arts" type focus, and I know that it and VWPP have an excellent relationship.

Scher	Gabrielle	Biology		French		3rd	2nd	1st		4th	I put Paris 7 as my first choice because that is the only university that has math and science classes.

I put Paris 4 as my first choice because I am interested in possibly taking an art history course while in Paris and that is the only university that offers art history.

Paris 4 also has interesting options of classes that apply to my majors.

Steele	Elena	International Studies	Political Science		History	3rd	1st	2nd			I chose Paris 4 and Paris 7 because they seem to offer more courses in political science and history which are the concentrations in my International Studies major. I researched all of the universities and I saw that the largest selection of humanities and social science courses are offered at Paris 4 and Paris 7. Paris 4 has the largest selection and is known for its international approach while Paris 7 is known for having multidisciplinary curriculum. I am interested in taking classes on EU government and France's colonial history and I believe these two universities will be best at allowing me to take the courses I want next semester.

Thorne	Evan	Computer Science		Math		2nd	3rd	1st	4th	5th	As a Math and Computer Science major, I am very comfortable with the sciences. Since science is my favorite subject, I think would be most interested in classes taken at Paris 7, and thus I think Paris 7 would be the best fit for me. In addition, I am also interested in language and cinema, which is why I think Paris 3 would make a good second choice.	My choice of university is not motivated by the calendar, but rather the fact that I plan to take a course for major credit at Paris 7 and am interested in the sciences.

Wilton	Rebecca	Art History		Romance Language Studies		3rd	1st	2nd	4th	5th	Paris IV is the only school with an official Art History program. I need to take at least two Art History courses while abroad, and it would be best if I had multiple course options to fit the requirements. Also, I am a Romance Language Studies major as well and need to take an Italian course while I'm in France - Paris IV also has an official Italian program and since my French comprehension is high enough I would like to take this course at the University also. Paris VII is my second choice because the classes sound similar in style to those offered at Wesleyan.	If I cannot take the Art History and Italian courses that I need to, the timeliness of my graduation will be in jeopardy.
