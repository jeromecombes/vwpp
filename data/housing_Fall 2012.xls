Andrews	Charlotte	Yes	Yes		I have traveled to Paris, France for several days.  I have also spent several days in France visiting Blois, Tours, & Cabourg.  I have traveled to England every other year and stayed for a couple weeks at a time.	I have not had this experience.	I live with my mother, father, and brother.  My brother is four years older than me.  My parents are both professors at Vassar College.	No	No	No		My principal academic reasons are to become fluent in French and further my study of French culture, particularly French art, literature, and political science.  My principal personal reasons for coming to Paris are to indulge in the beauty and culture of the city and explore the arts, cuisine, entertainment, architecture, and intricate history of Paris.	My main academic interests are French language and cultural studies and international politics.  I am also interested in literature, art history, and philosophy.	I am passionate about gourmet food, desserts, and wine.  I love shopping and am very involved in fashion.  I am also passionate about architecture and art history.  I enjoy theater, and both jazz and classical music.  As far as activities, I engage in outdoor activities and sports often and enjoy hiking in the countryside.  I love exploring and traveling, particularly for culinary and cultural experiences.  In general I am a socialite and spend a lot of time with my friends.	No	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	I have several food intolerances, and occasionally certain foods can bother my stomach and I have reactions to them.  When this happens, I will need to avoid certain foods for a day or two, but it is not usually a problem.		No	No allergies.	It is very important to me that I live in a nice, safe (and preferably beautiful) neighborhood, preferably close to a metro station so that I will not have to walk far at night.  I would be very happy in an upscale neighborhood, but the distance to Reid Hall is also important to me (preferably around 15 minutes of commuting time).  I'd love to live in an area near shopping and restaurants or other daytime activities.  My other priority is living with interesting, nice people who will be glad to have me, and will still give me privacy.	First	Second	I would love if my host family has kids in high school or in a university.  I would not mind living with young children, however I have no experience with that.  I absolutely love dogs and I hope to live with one!  I enjoy studying somewhere other than my room, so preferably they wouldn't mind me in the living room.  Concerning smoking, I do not mind if someone smokes occasionally, but I answered "no" to living with a smoker just in case I end up with a person who subjects me to constant second-hand smoke.  I tend to go to sleep late.  I am very interested in art, fashion, music, traveling, and outdoor activities.  I am passionate about gourmet food and French cuisine.  I am very social and would love to live near a thriving social scene.  Lastly, I have an immense appreciation for Gothic architecture and other styles of architecture in France, so I would be thrilled to live in a very historic area with interesting buildings.
Bjornson	Julius	No	Yes		Some traveling throughout Europe, though as yet no time spent in France. Living in a student apartment in Regensburg, Germany from January-August 2012 (directly prior to VWPP).	Not yet.	Divorced [though supportive and loving!] parents: father (47) is a metallurgical and structural engineer working as a civilian employee of the US Navy, mother (44) is a massage therapist. No siblings. Grew up with both dogs and cats in the house at all times.	Yes	Yes	Yes	I would somewhat prefer the independence of living in an apartment setting where I am responsible for my own shopping, cleaning and well-being, as I am currently accustomed to it. However, I have no opposition to a home-stay situation. It is naturally somewhat more comfortable for me, as a student and an independent adult, to be able to come and go on my own schedule, though I presume this would not present any major problems in either case.	I would like to improve my french-speaking ability, and believe I can reach near-fluency during four months in Paris given my current ability. Living in Europe and experiencing a variety of metropolitan settings throughout the world also appeal to me strongly, as well as making friends wherever I go. I am giving serious thought to living in Europe after graduation, and, Paris being a likely location, I would love to know it and some of its citizens well beforehand.	Music, languages (French, German: linguistics is unfortunately not a viable option at Wesleyan) and comparative cultures.	Various music-related (performing, practicing, sound engineering, etc), films, walking around. Coffee, reading, talking with friends, making acquaintances.	Regular smoker	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None.	Pizza should be eaten by hand, and not with a fork and a knife.	No	No known allergies, though I react badly to Americans who are loud in public.	I will need to be able to practice music in my room. I play fiddle and acoustic guitar, so it is generally not exceedingly loud. Having the ability to spend time with friends at home on a regular basis is a serious preference.	First	Second	Living with children is not a problem for me, although as a smoker I would prefer not to. I love animals and am interested in a wide variety of topics. I am very respectful of all religions, but would not appreciate living in a situation where I would be wanted to adhere to specific beliefs or practices. I am fairly quiet at home, though I like to listen to music in my room without headphones. I generally study outside of the home and sleep between 2-11AM, but if my sleep schedule must be adjusted it certainly can during the week. I do not like to wake up weekends if I do not have to.
Carr	Margaret	Yes	Yes		I visited Paris for four days on a family vacation in 2004. I've also traveled to England and Canada (once to Nova Scotia and once to Alberta).	In 2004, my family hosted a German student, Phil, for one month as part of an exchange that my older brother did in high school. It was a fun experience to help introduce Phil to life in America and hear about Germany in his broken English.	I live with both of my parents. My mom is works for our township recreation department, and my dad works in international freight shipping and customs brokerage. My brother is 23 and works as a theater electrician and technical designer.	No	No	No	I'm excited to have more independence than we get in the dorms here at Vassar, and I am also looking forward to being able to cook for myself.	I've studied french since the seventh grade, and I really want to go to Paris and improve my language skills, especially my speaking/pronunciation and listening comprehension. I want to live in the city and experience the vibrancy and the history of the place. I want to learn more about French culture and see and experience what life is like for Parisians.	I am a history major with an art history correlate. I'm interested in french colonial history. I love medieval architecture and 19th century french art, especially Courbet and Manet.	I spend a lot of time reading and listening to music. I love sports, especially baseball and soccer. I enjoy being outside, and in cities I love walking around and seeing life on the streets.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None.	None.	No	None.	I'd love to live in an area with a real neighborhood feel, located so that I can easily explore other parts of Paris. I'm a bit concerned about being homesick, so a friendly host who could help me adjust would be a plus.	First	Second	I like both kids and animals. I spend a lot of time watching and reading about sports. I'm generally pretty neat, although the messiness of my room tends to increase with my stress level. I usually study in my room, normally at night. I tend to stay up late, and while I wouldn't call myself and early bird, I rarely sleep super late into the day.
Conrad	Caroline	Yes	Yes		I spent a week with my family in Paris and a week in Provence when I was 16. I have spent about four weeks in Costa Rica over the last year, and have also spent between 1-2 weeks in England, Wales, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, St. Lucia, Grenada, Peru, Mexico, Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands, Italy, and Canada.	No	My parents have been happily married for 25 years; my father is an environmental lawyer with his own practice and my mother works for the General Services Administration of the government. I have one older sister, Liza, who is 23 and moved to Costa Rica last year after graduating from Wesleyan as a government major with a focus in development. She now works as the liaison between the Costa Rican and North Carolina Episcopal Dioceses. My family is very supportive, out-spoken and honest with each other; I am very lucky to have been raised in a home that fosters such self-efficacy and joy for life.	No	Yes	Yes		I've been enamored with Paris since I was a young girl; I am a hopeless clich√© in that I find Paris, and France in general, beautifully romantic. I'm passionate about fashion, food, and art, and as a film student, Paris is the obvious center of my interests. I loved the city the minute I set foot in it and immediately decided I had to study there while in college. Don't think I'm cheesy, but I'm a huge fan of brie.	As a film studies and psychology double major, I've been studying how film reflects the society and culture of both its creators and its contemporary audiences, especially when compared to how audiences today perceive them. I find French film particularly interesting because of the tendency towards episodic plots and I would like to be able to study and observe how aspects of French history and culture have influenced film. I am currently studying the history of psychology in America and would love to do a similar study of French psychology; immersion into Parisian society will give me a much better perspective from which to do this.	I would really like to take ballet and cooking classes, in addition to finding a gym or way to stay physically active. I love swimming, tennis, soccer, hiking, and generally being outdoors so I'm really looking forward to exploring the city on foot and becoming familiar with my neighborhood. I'm excited to revisit churches and museums, I loved all of the art I saw when I was last in Paris and I plan on spending a lot of time loitering in the museums.	No	No	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes	No	No	I am allergic to sesame and mildly to tomatoes and peas; I am lactose intolerant, but I can eat cheese and very little amounts of cream sauce, but not milk or cream. I have been vegetarian my entire life and am not able to digest meat or meat products; I have irritable bowel syndrome and am very sensitive to certain foods; there may be times when I cannot eat anything except very basic foods that I know don't upset my stomach. I am very sensitive about offending or burdening people because of my dietary restrictions and it's very important to me that my host family be understanding and open with me in regard to food. I love to cook and would be more than happy to help with the cooking in any way I can.		Yes	I am allergic to cats and dogs, but I love animals so I would be happy to live with a home with a hypoallergenic pet, or a small animal. I am also allergic to grass, pollen, trees, and any anti-biotics in the zythromax family. I will need to get allergy shots every three weeks so I will have to find a nurse or practitioner to administer them.	My dietary restrictions are really my primary concern because if I get sick it can become really problematic for me. It's really important to me that my host family be understanding and accepting about my dietary restrictions and understand that it largely isn't a conscious choice, but necessary because of how my body reacts to certain foods.	First	Second	I love children and animals and would prefer to live in a family with either because I am pretty energetic and extroverted so I like to be around more people and activity. I love animals so I'd be happy to live in a home with pets as long as they didn't shed profusely, especially in the room I'll be sleeping in. I am interested in food, traveling, clothes and jewelry, film, dancing, and other types of art. I am not messy and do not like to be around clutter or mess because it can make me feel stressed out. I am a very early riser and delightful morning person, I usually wake up between 7 and 8 am and I can make fantastic waffles.
Edwards	Ian	No	Yes		Yes -  - Germany June 16 -July 4, 2008 - France  22 June - 26 June 2008 - Great Britain June 29-July 1 2008 -  - 11 July- August 9 2009 - Germany; Austria; Italy; Luxembourg; Belgium -  - March 17, 2010 to March 24, 2010 - France; Italy  -  - WILL BE IN GERMANY FROM JUNE TO AUGUST PRIOR TO THIS PROGRAM.	No	We're pretty close. I have one brother who will be a freshman at Vassar next year so we were of a similar age growing up. My parents are both teachers at a small school which I attend for the 13 years prior to Vassar. I was more than comfortable and happy being around them for a significant amount of my day which has left me more than open to the possibility of being placed in a family setting.	No	No	No	I'm more than comfortable cooking pasta on a daily basis for myself--really--but I'd be more than happy to live in/participate in a family cooking setting. I'm really quite open to a wide range of housing situations, but the idea of a family setting is rather appealing.	Strong personal desire to solidify my french, discover more of the french culture, and conduct some research for my senior International Studies thesis.	International Relations. - Linguistics - Capitalism - Economics - Law - Islamic/Western Interactions - Arabic Immigration into Europe.	I really enjoy hanging out with and making new friends, visiting museums/cultural sites, working out, sports, learning new languages, discussing politics.	No	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None	None	No	No	I'm really easy going but also cognizant of my responsibilities as a member of a household and therefore think I could live pretty much anywhere. I'm friendly and will definitely set earning the trust of my host family as an immediate priority. My one request would be that, if possible, I'd like to be placed in a non-smoking household.	First	Second	Children are fantastic--often one of the best ways for me to get language practice as well as sources of babysitting income as the situation arises. I'd be more than happy to be an English (or German or Arabic for that matter) tutor. That said, some of the most fascinating people that I've met and friends that I've made have been older adults. Animals are fine. Study/noise/sleeping habits are completely negotiable on my end and I can adept myself with struggle to essentially any of those. I perhaps tend to stay up a bit late now, but that can definitely be modified.
Ellman	Hannah	Yes	Yes		I have never been to France, nor have I ever spent a significant amount of time in another country. I have taken trips with my family to a few foreign countries including England and Ecuador, however these trips were never for longer than three weeks.	I have never had a home stay with a foreign family; however, when I was in middle school my family hosted a high school student from Spain for a portion of the summer. The experience was wonderful and the student became a part of our family for the time that she stayed with us. I was drawn to the home stay option for this program because of that experience.	My family consists of my mother, my father, my brother, and me. My mother (53 years old) works full time as a grant writer for a community health center in New Haven, CT, approximately twenty minutes from my home. My father (53 years old) also works in New Haven at Yale University; he is a doctor of internal medicine and also teaches Yale medical students. My brother is two years older than me, a philosophy major at Haverford College. He is graduating this May.	No	No	No	Since I have never had an experience in an independent living situation, this type of housing will be new for me.	I want to come to Paris for many reasons. Most importantly, I am fascinated with the history, I want to be fluent in French, and I want to have a completely alternative college experience. I have been reading and studying French culture- food, styles, art, and architecture- since middle school and want to see and experience that culture in person!	The summer after my junior year of high school, I participated in a program through which I volunteered on a Navajo reservation in New Mexico. That experience has been the driving force for my academic pursuits at Vassar. I am an American Culture major with foci in Native American Studies and History. I am also being certified to teach Secondary Education in Social Studies. I hope some day to teach high school history in a way that allows me to incorporate my passion for Native American Studies.	At the center of my extra-curricular interests in music, and more specifically, singing. I am a member of the Vassar College Night Owls, one of the oldest, all female, continuously running, collegiate a cappella groups in the nation. I am also currently taking voice lessons and am a member of the Vassar College Choir. I have been singing and performing since before I can remember. In my spare time I also like to fiddle around on the guitar, read books and magazines for pleasure, write (mostly journal writing and poetry), socialize with my friends, and dance alone in my room.	No	No	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes	No	No			Yes	I love dogs and cats! The only thing I am allergic to in the medicine cyclor.	I am particularly worried about my vegetarianism. I do not want to disrespect my host family by needing to refuse a dish that has meat in it, or to make anyone uncomfortable if I am worried that a dish has meat and proceed to ask about it. I am also worried about initially getting to know my host family. I am a very respectful and friendly person but it sometimes takes me a long time to open up to people and I am concerned that since I will also be speaking only French for the first time that my shyness will take over.	First	Second	I love animals. Living in a home that has friendly pets would be wonderful. I would be fine living with older children. I am not extremely neat but not messy; I do not want to be in a messy home, but would also be uncomfortable in a home in which I would be constantly anxious about misplacing something. Somewhere in between would be great. I can basically study anywhere as long as it is quiet. In general, I need low levels of noise when I am trying to work and even lower noise when I am trying to sleep.  I love my sleep! But I also love to bake, sing, listen to music, and laugh loudly.
Evans	Brian	Yes	Yes		France (Paris and Biarritz), Spain, England, Austria, Italy, Germany, Czech Republic, Peru, Venezuela, Australia, St. Barthes, Anguilla, St. Lucia, St. Martin, Canada, Mexico, Fiji & Rarotonga, Israel, Jordan- few weeks		My household consists only of my parents and I, given that I am an only child.  My family lives in Los Angeles.  My parents have been married for 21 years. My father is 66 years old and is the CEO of an insurance company.  My mother is 53 years old, originally from Peru, and works as claims examiner for an insurance company.  With my own car, I maintain a great deal of freedom while at home.  Though I am very close with my parents, as I have traveled extensively with them to the aforementioned locations.	No	Yes	No	My first experience of sharing a room with another person came during my first year in college in a dormitory.  The experience was influential enough to elect a single room without roommates for my second year.	I have taken French for quite some time, and have been a Francophile for as long as I can remember.  I love French cuisine and culture.  With this opportunity I hope to develop a more well rounded understanding of the culture I am so passionate about, granted by the longer time I will have in France.  I am deeply interested in chateaux and French rococo architecture, which I hope to explore during my time there.	I am creating an independent major entitled "The Sister Arts: Literature & Visual Arts," hoping to focus on art and literature of antique France.  By studying anthropology, philosophy, art history and literature, I hope to create a comprehensive and macroscopic study of the relationship between literature and visual arts in France at this time.  My particular focus within French art includes rococo artwork, as well as 19th century artworks.  For literature, my interest lies in decadent literature of the fin-de-si√®cle.  I am also interested in commodity culture, male aestheticism and sex and gender studies.  I also plan to pursue a correlate study in International Economics.  I speak Spanish, French and am learning German currently.	I am very interested in fashion, having attended NY Fashion Week a few times, and (hopefully) trying to see a few shows in Paris.  I love opera (specifically Italian), musical theatre and attending the ballet.  I enjoy visiting museums and galleries.	No	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes			Yes	I am allergic to cats.	I know France is a deeply Catholic country.  As a gay man, my main priority regarding housing would be to be placed with a house that would be most comfortable with me, and reciprocally me with them.	First	Second	I am a very neat and orderly person, with a dedicated study habit when it comes to working.  I would say my sleeping habits are pretty regular (studying at night until 12 or 1, awake by 7, 8 or 9).  As an only child, I am not accustomed to being with children, especially younger ones, and animals - though I do not mind dogs.  As aforementioned, I have deep passions for the arts, high fashion, weekend traveling and French food (no food allergies).  I am Catholic, though not practicing.  I grew up in a private neighborhood in the hills of LA with very little noise, so would prefer less noise. I usually like to shower at least twice a day.
Garrick-Okoli	Isabelle	Yes			I have never been to France. I lived in Nigeria for 14 years. I have been to the UK at different times for varying lengths of time.	No.	I have one brother who is 17 years old and in boarding school. My mother raised both us on her own and worked for herself until recently.	No	No	No		I would like to bring my language to fluency. I would like to explore a new city/country. I would like to look at possible graduate school options.	I am a psychology major and hopeful french minor. I would like to do something business related after graduation.	They change all the time.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None.	None.	No	Hay fever/Nasal allergies. I've never lived with a pet so I don't know if they exacerbate my symptoms but I have watched people's pets for short periods of time and was fine after.		First		I would like to be placed in a home with children but preferably not more than two. I do not mind dogs terribly but would much rather not live with a cat. I sometimes go to sleep very late but I typically will not disturb people around me with noise or lights. Regarding my interests I spend a huge chunk of my free time reading blogs but I'm usually interested in learning/trying new things.
Hoffman	Ethan	Yes	Yes		I have been to France twice before, both times in 2008. The first trip was for two weeks as part of an exchange program with a school in La Roche-sur-Yon in Vend√©e. The second was with a friend over the summer to visit the friends I had made there earlier, and to spend a week with my second cousins who live just outside Paris. In total, the second trip was about a month.	When I was on my high school exchange program, I was hosted by a family in Saint-Gilles Croix-de-Vie. The Guilbauds were very welcoming. They had three kids, one my age, one younger and one older, and I very much was impressed by the differences in parent-child relationships between France and the US.	My family consists of my mom, 60, a pediatric nurse, my sister, 15, and myself. My dad passed away a year ago at the age of 58, he had been a math tutor and before that a geologist and environmental consultant.	Yes	Yes	Yes	I can take care of myself if I need to, although I enjoy living with people. In general, I prefer when my living space to be non-hierarchical, living with my peers.	My main reasons for coming to Paris are to study psychoanalysis in the French tradition, to become fluent or more proficient in French, and to experience cultural differences.	My principal academic interests are in psychology, specifically cultural, social, emotional, political and existential psychology. I am also very interested in the sociology, history and philosophy of social scientific practice and theory, particularly clinical psychology, applied psychology (forensics) and psychopharmacology. Outside of those two interests which constitute my double major in Psychology and Science in Society, I am quite interested in writing and specifically journalism, although I try to read and do a fair amount of poetry writing. I am also very interested, in a broad sense, in education.	In my free time I play guitar, walk around and take photographs, listen to the radio, read the news, chat with friends, occasionally write. On the weekend I enjoy drinking and partying, but nothing too crazy.	Regular smoker	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None	Dietary Customs: Consume Food on Plate with a Fork, Knife, and from time to time, Spoon.	No	I am mildly allergic to dogs, although only once has a dog, I think, bothered my asthma. I am also slightly allergic to cats, though less than I am to dogs, and live with a cat when I am home during breaks.	My principal concern in housing is living somewhere centrally located near Reid Hall, Sciences Po and Paris 3. Aside from that, I would prefer to live with people near my age, but I am flexible as far as that goes.	Second	First	I don't make a lot of noise (I think) but I am planning on brining my guitar with me to Paris, though if noise is an issue I can play it outside. I love cats, dislike dogs, and am generally OK with children. I can cook, and am very interested in food and French food in particular. I will make latkes for chanukah. I am also interested in photography, journalism and the outdoors. I tend to go to bed relatively late and wake up relatively late.
Ichizawa	Maria	Yes	Yes		I visited the south of France when I was thirteen for two weeks. When I was seventeen, I did a summer exchange with a French girl. She visited me in America for three weeks, and the next summer I went to visit her in France, and stayed with her and her family for three weeks in Bretagne and Normandy. I also lived in a small village of Japan until I was nine years old.	Yes, I had a home stay experience with the French family mentioned above. I had a wonderful time getting to know them, and they were so kind in adopting me into their family for three weeks. By the end of the visit, I felt like a second daughter. Because of this, I hope to find the same feeling of closeness with my host family in Paris. I hope to become part of the family, and to make close connections with the person or people with whom I am living.	My father is Japanese, and teaches Japanese at a high school in New Hampshire. I speak mainly Japanese with him. I have a younger sister, Sophia, who is 14. My mother, who was American, was a journalist, but she passed away when I was 13.	No				I hope to become as fluent as possible in French by going to Paris. Being in Paris will also teach me how to live in a city, as I have grown up in small towns, and have never lived in a large city before. I also hope to create lasting connections with the people of France, and learn more about their culture and lifestyle. As I want to go into an international career, getting to know various corners and nooks of Paris will truly help me learn about France, and therefore will make me a more globally aware person. Paris is both culturally and historically rich, as well as a modern and international city. Paris is the city of high culture and art, aspects of life that are very important to me. I hope to become enriched by my surroundings as I see the sights and meet the people of Paris.	My primary academic interest is becoming fluent in French. I also want to learn more about French culture and lifestyle. As an Asian studies major, I have a strong interest in the link between Japan and France. I hope to study what Japanese influences there are in French culture, as well as how French culture plays into Japan, and perhaps write a senior thesis on it.	I love music - in my spare time I play viola and sing. I am in an orchestra, quartet and choir at Vassar. When I have time I also like to paint and read, as well make Japanese food!	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	No		I eat very minimal red meat - especially beef. If there is some beef in a soup or with dinner, I will eat it, but I prefer not to, for both moral and dietary reasons. However, I do love seafood and poultry!	No	I am not allergic to anything, but I am very sensitive to dusty houses.	Ideally, I would love to live with a family who has a child my age, who can show me around Paris. But primarily, I want a family with whom I can form close knit ties to help me feel like I have a home in a strange country. I don't mind if there are kids, but I would probably prefer either my own age or under six years old. My biggest concern is that my host family and I will be distant from each other.	First	Second	I love cats, and pets in general. I would love to get to know someone my age or slightly older, but I am also good with children, especially age six and under. I am clean, and relatively neat, though when in a rush I don't always fold/hang my clean clothes. Usually because of work, I will go to bed relatively late - probably 1 or 2 am. I also hope to be in a location where I can be close to the metro, or a walkable distance from school, if at all possible. I also hope that my family will be interested in the arts, especially music. I also want to stay active, so hopefully I can live in an area where I can go for short runs and safely explore. In general, I would like to be placed with a family who I can become close to, because I believe that that is the best way to improve my French, learn about French culture, and have a place to call home while in a strange city. I think that the home stay is one of the most valuable aspects of studying abroad, and the best way to be completely immersed in a foreign country.
Lee	Vera	Yes	Yes		I have lived in Paris for 2 weeks with my parents in a rented apartment for a vacation.	I did 6-week homestay in Tokyo, Japan last summer while taking Japanese language classes.  I lived with a young couple with a 13-year old daughter, an experience which I enjoyed immensely.  The chambre dans un appartement with three dinners a week sounds like a great arrangement; I will have more freedom to eat when I want, but will not be completely cut off from my host, whom I hope to get to know well.	I am an only child and am very close with my parents.  Both my parents work full-time jobs and usually are not home until around 8pm, but we try to have dinner together as often as we can when I am home.	No	Yes	Yes	I have never lived on my own or alone with someone else my own age, but I can cook for myself without trouble.  3 dinners a week prepared by my host sounds perfect.	To learn to speak French fluently, to become more familiar with French culture, and to experience the world from a different point of view.	Economics, Art History, literature	I sing in choir, am a member of Vassar's Asian Students' Alliance, cook, and enjoy making comics.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		I am open to all kinds of food.  Everything tastes better in France!	Yes	Slightly allergic to dust.	Proximity to my classes.	First	Second	I usually will not go to sleep later than 2am, am relatively neat, and am very easily woken up by noise, so I would prefer a quieter area.
Lopez	Sydney	Yes	Yes		I have not spent a prolonged amount of time outside of the United States.	N/A	My parents are divorced, so my time is spent split between my father and mother. My older sister is a Junior in college, and my little brother is a freshman in high school. My parents both work in the banking/housing industry.	No	Yes	No	As a relatively independent person, I would like to be placed with a more trusting, and open-minded family who can understand the needs and attitudes of a younger person. I woud like for a caring and warm home environment while I am abroad, as well as to be placed with a family who is in touch with the current modes of life in Paris. I enjoy cooking for myself, I enjoy doing a lot of things independently, however, I really would like to placed with a family who will not mind if I cook, and will not mind my own comings and goings. I of course understand the need to respectful of the schedule and preferences of my host family. I am interested in media, journalism, as well as fashion, and as Paris is a a global capital of the three, I believe it would greatly benefit my studies and career to be placed with a family whose parental figures work in one of the aforementioned industries. I believe I can gain a lot from living with a family whose life is oriented towards things I am interested in, because I will be able to further my knowledge, and have some common ground with the family I am living with.	My principal reasons for coming to Paris are to improve my French language skills, improve my understanding of the French culture, as well as exploring the way of life somewhere outside the United States. As a Media Studies and International Politics student, I am always interested in gaining new perspectives and insight into the global arena, and France's position as leader in the cultural and political sphere's are of definite interest to me.	My main academic interests are primarily related to Media, Culture/Sociology, and Political Science. I am greatly interested the relationships formed between the three and their ability to shape and influence each other. My interests range from political science, literature, philosophy, economics, writing, broadcast journalism, and the like. I also have vested interests in the arts, such a photography, design, painting, singing, and drawing.	I have a very broad spectrum of extra curricular activities which range from athletics to art. I am an avid runner and tennis player, and enjoy being outdoors, and doing activities such as hiking. I am also a singer, and enjoy making music very much. Furthermore, I have a large interest in fashion, design, and art. I usually have some side projects that I engage in just for fun outside of my academics, which include painting and the like.	Occasional smoker	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		I don't have any strict dietary habits, however, I am conscientious eater. I try to structure my diet around foods that are healthy as well as environmentally conscious. I don't generally eat fast-food or things like that , however I am by no means a picky eater. I am really open to trying new foods and generally eat most foods.	No	I have no known allergies, except for common seasonal allergies.	My principal concern is being placed in a family that is not very receptive to having students live with them. I know this sounds silly as they sign up to host students, but I have heard a lot of "horror" stories about bad host family situations, i.e. families who only sign up for the monetary compensation, and the like. I am a very friendly, open-minded person, and I want a family who can reciprocate those qualities. I would really like to be placed with a family who will aid me in making a comfortable transition into life in France.	First	Second	I am generally a pretty neat person, but definitely not obsessively neat. I really would prefer to live with a family who isn't too messy but also isn't overly strict about cleanliness. I value my alone time, and definitely can't be placed in a too cramped situation, as I can get very claustrophobic. I go to bed at a relatively normal hour during the weekdays, generally around 12 - 1 am. On the weekends I definitely go to bed later, generally around 2-3 am. I study during afternoons and evenings, and I do have a little trouble focusing sometimes, which is where my need to a personal, quiet space comes in handy. I love love love animals, particularly dogs. As I have my own pets, I would actually feel more comfortable living with a household that has pets. I have a really large breadth of interests and would love for them to be broadened by living with a family whose parental figures are engaged in that industry. These include journalism (print or radio), fashion design, and singing. If a person whose livelihood is a merger of these interests, such as someone who writes for a fashion magazine or a newspaper or a cultural magazine, I would love to live with them to gain more insight into that field. I would really like a family that has a mixture of ages of children, teenagers and younger kids are okay, and I am actually more comfortable with families that have children.
Madwed	Isaac	Yes	Yes		I traveled in Israel, France and London during the summer of 2008.  I traveled in Israel again in 2009 as part of a youth program.  I have been to Canada many times throughout my life.	I hosted a student from France in high school.  I enjoyed making a new friend, but had some difficulties due to differences in our ideas of neatness.  Despite this I would be excited to live with a family or roommate and am willing to make compromises.	My parents are both family doctors and are married.  My brother is 18 years old and will attend Bucknell next year.  My sister is 14 and is precocious.	No	Yes	No	It has little effect on my housing preference.  I do not often cook for myself, but am capable of doing so.  I look forward to having a flexible housing situation.	I hope to learn more and enjoy much of French culture.  I also hope to become near fluent in the language.	To fulfill four credits of my French major at Wesleyan.	I draw, listen to music, watch television, occasionally run, and read.	Occasional smoker	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes			No		My main concern is maintaining my ability to make my own hours.	Second	First	
Morgan	Anya	Yes	Yes		I have been to France around three or four times with my family (Paris, Normandy, and the south of France).  I spent a summer in Switzerland (La Chaux-de-Fonds) with Swiss relatives of mine.  I've also traveled to many other foreign countries with my family--but no other French-speaking countries.	No.	I have a mother who is a high school English teacher, a father who is a lawyer, and a 17 year old sister who will be attending Wesleyan in the fall (hooray!).	No	Yes	Yes	Although I've never lived in an apartment/house that was completely independent, I have had several experiences with a roommate and I have found that I always find a way to get along with them.  I'm fairly independent, but I'm also good at compromising.  I prefer to prepare my own meals rather than have them prepared for me, so living with a roommate and cooking with them would be an enjoyable experience.	I want to explore Parisian culture and improve my French.  I'd like to get to a level of fluency that not only allows me to carry on a simple conversation, but gives me access to the intricacies and colloquialisms of the French language.	I'm interested in literature and film--which I've already taken French courses in and want to explore further--and also translation.  I've never taken a course in translation but I'm curious to see what it's all about.  I've toyed with the idea of becoming some kind of translator in the future.	I am a huge yoga enthusiast and plan to pursue yoga classes in Paris if possible.  I also love to read and play bass guitar (I may or may not be bringing my acoustic bass, depending on packing space).	Occasional smoker	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	N/A	I have mildly disordered eating (EDNOS) and eating in a group setting sometimes is complicated for me--I would prefer to be placed in an apartment so I can prepare my own meals if at all possible.	Yes	No.	My only concern is my EDNOS as it could make eating with a family awkward.  If the two apartments are taken, however, I'm sure I will be able to work it out in a way that's comfortable for me.	Second	First	I like dogs and tolerate cats.  I don't mind children or messiness.  I usually need a quiet place to study but I'm adaptable. I usually go to sleep late and sleep in if possible, but again, I'm adaptable.
Myerberg	Nicholas	Yes	Yes		I've never spent more than three weeks in a foreign country. In 2003, I spent a week in Paris. In 2009, I spent three weeks in Cambodia. I spent a month in Canada in 2007, but I'm not sure that counts.	I've never had a home stay experience, nor have I ever hosted an international student.	My father is 69 and, while semi-retired, is a consultant to non-profit organizations and remains on the faculty at Columbia. My mother is 60 and no longer works, but was an educator and sign language interpreter for many years. I have three brothers, all substantially older. Two are 34--one lives in London and works in finance, while the other live in New York City and is an attorney--and one is 31, and is a writer.	Yes	Yes	Yes	I've enjoyed living independently and cooking for myself. It makes me a more productive individual and allows me the opportunity to work, eat, and sleep at hours conducive to my own schedule, which I find to be a substantial factor in my overall sense of well-being. I would therefore strongly prefer to live in an apartment with another student rather than with a home stay family.	Principally, I want to study things that I cannot study here--viz., psychoanalysis. In addition, I think that going abroad would allow me to gain perspective on what I'm doing here at Wesleyan, giving me the mental stamina I need to come back and write a great thesis.	I'm interested in psychoanalysis, continental philosophy, critical/aesthetic/cultural theory (if that is at all different from continental philosophy; the jury is still out), belles lettres, cultural studies, etc.	I play guitar; I read fiction; I draw (poorly)	Regular smoker	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes			Yes	mold.	I have some anxiety about living with a LOT of strangers (especially older strangers), so my preference would be to live either in a colocation with younger French people, or in a home stay with no more than two other people.	Second	First	I can't deal with children; I love animals. I'm generally neat if I have to be. I work (at least at Wesleyan) until as late as 3 or 4am, so my sleeping patterns reflect this. I'm not very noisy, but I can tolerate noisy people.
Peterson-Cochrane	Chloe	Yes	Yes		I have spent a couple days each in England, Germany, Italy, France, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. I have spent about a week in both Austria and the Czech Republic, and did a 10-day homestay in Japan as part of a Rotary exchange program.	Yes, I have done both. I hosted two Japanese exchange students during the summers of 2008/2009 for about 5 days each. It was a fun experience, and I am still in contact with both the girls who stayed with me. I also stayed with 3 host families when I was in Japan, each for about 3 days. I really loved that my hosts didn't treat me like a guest, but simply incorporated me into their daily routine. I would love it if my French host family did the same.	I am an only child, and live with my parents. My mother is a psychologist and my father is a lawyer, and they work pretty long hours. I enjoy the alone time, but my parents and I are close and make an effort to spend time together in the evenings and on weekends.	No	No	No	I like to cook for myself, but other than that I would like a traditional family living experience. I haven't really enjoyed living in a dorm setting, and have never lived in an apartment/house setting before.	I want to become fluent in French, experience French culture, and live in a major European city.	I am an anthropology and French double major, but I also enjoy art, literature, and especially history.	I enjoy hiking, playing tennis, reading, and Pilates in my spare time. I love history and art, so I plan to spend a lot of time going to museums and historical sites in the Paris area. In terms of leisure time, I love movies, television, and music. I don't really watch many French TV shows/movies, or listen to much French music, but I would love to be introduced to my host family's favorites.	No	No	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	None.	I am a picky eater, but other than the preferences expressed above, I don't have anything to add other that I avoid pork (except bacon) because I am Jewish. I also fast for Yom Kippur and go kosher for Passover.	Yes	I have medical allergies (ceclor and zithromax), but no other allergies.	I really want a family that I can get to know and be a part of. In Japan, I loved that my families didn't treat me like a guest, but instead as just part of the family. My primary concern would be living with a family that is committed to getting to know me, and won't just leave me alone to do my own thing. At the same time, I value my independence, and hope my host family would as well.	First	Second	I have a dog, and I would really like to be placed in a household with pets (any kind). I wouldn't object to living with children, but am not wedded to the idea. I am very neat, and I primarily use my bedroom as a study space, so it is important to me that the household I join be relatively quiet. I sleep pretty well, since I basically can't function without a good night's sleep, and I tend to go to bed sometime between 9-11 pm. I consider myself a morning person, though I like sleeping in on the weekends.
Ripecky	Zoe	No	Yes		I travelled to France last summer to visit my cousin who was studying in Angers through a Notre Dame University program. This was a two week trip. Two summers ago I studied at the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv, Ukraine for 3 weeks. I stayed in an apartment provided by the program with 10 other students.	No	I have a traditional family, my father is a doctor and my mother is a homemaker and previous pianist. My sister is 25 and is a college volleyball and softball assistant coach and graduate student at Depauw University in Indiana. We have a dog and a cat.	Yes	Yes	Yes	This experience highlights my ability to live alone. I am confident that I will be able to live independently while still interacting as much as I can with my host family.	My principal reasons for coming to Paris are: to master the French language, to study in an environment different from the one I'm used to, and to explore a foreign culture.	I am an International Studies major with foci in Political Science and Economics. While in Paris I am interested in looking into classes in these areas as well as others such as  Sociology and Art History.	At Vassar, I am a member of the varsity lacrosse team. I enjoy playing various other sports and I run often. At Vassar I also serve as secretary of the sophomore class on Student Council. I enjoy spending most of my time outside. I am also interested in volunteer opportunities available while in Paris.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes					I think my principal priorities are a good location with easy accessibility to classes and the city, as well as an amicable and welcoming family.	First	Second	I like children and animals. I am moderately neat. I like to study in the library rather than in my room. On weeknights I go to bed fairly early and on weekends I tend to stay up later. I appreciate quiet at nighttime.
Ruffner	Zoe	Yes	Yes		I have visited Paris many times. Also, after my freshman year of high school, I lived with a French family in the south of France for a month. The next summer, I lived in a dorm in Paris and took courses for a month.	Yes. My summer after my freshman year of high school, I lived with a French family in the south of France for a month. I greatly enjoyed the experience of living with this family. My French improved so much around them because they refused to speak English with me. They were incredibly helpful in teaching me how to say what I wanted to and in helping me find the words I needed. For these reasons, I would like to live with a French family in Paris next semester.	I live with my mom and stepdad (both actors.) My stepsister (age 22) spent half of her time with us while she was in high school, and the other half with her mom. My dad (owns a greeting card company) lives in Michigan with my stepmom, stepsister (21), stepbrother (23), and half-sister (6).	Yes	No	Yes	I've lived alone, but I would rather live with a French family so that I can learn French.	My main reason for coming to Paris is that I want to become fluent in French and strongly believe it's impossible to do so without actually having to use French everyday. I love Paris and want to live in, explore, and get to know the city. I want to experience something new -- a different culture, people I don't know, a language I am not fluent in, etc. I know this will be a huge learning experience, and, as a student, I think it's incredibly important to take advantage of the opportunity.	French, English, and writing are my main academic interests. I am a double French and English major.	Dancing, reading, writing, member of Method Magazine at Wesleyan, horseback riding, visiting galleries and museums, photography, reading fashion magazines and blogs, going to concerts	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None	None	No	No	My principal concern is location. I would really like to be placed in the center of Paris. My ideal location would be the 6th or 3rd arrondissement.  - I would really love to live with the Barnathan family. I have a friend who is abroad in Paris right now staying with them, and she says they are an absolutely wonderful host family.	First	Second	I would really love to live with the Barnathan family. If not, I am fine with children and animals. Neatness is important to me. I generally go to sleep late and sleep in if I have the opportunity to do so.
Scriptunas	Tess	Yes	Yes		I have traveled to France twice and stayed for between a week and 10 days both times.	Yes, I had an exchange student from Australia in high school who stayed with me for 3 weeks and who I visited for 3 weeks.  This experience made me realize how nice it is to stay with a family, as it was very comforting to have that support in a foreign country.	I am an only child and live with my parents in our apartment in Brooklyn, New York.  My father is an art handler, and my mother is a child social worker.	No	No	No	N/A	I am a French Studies major, and so have obvious academic reasons for going to Paris.  In addition, I have never lived for an extended period of time in a different country, so although I have visited Paris briefly before I am very much looking forward to actually being a part of the culture and the city.	I am and English and French major, so I am essentially interested in literature and language.	I dance, tutor, write in my free time, and am a member of the social business club on campus.  I am also very interested in the visual arts	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		N/A	None that should pose a conflict	No	None	I would like to be with a family or with a young couple: basically to have a social experience rather than a more independent experience where I was left alone.  I am also not particularly picky about which arrondisement I live in, but would prefer to be in an arrondissement rather than a banlieue	First	Second	My absolutely first choice in terms of housing would be to live with Sabine Denoix if she chooses to host a student again, as I have a friend who stayed with her last semester and had an excellent experience.  As a second choice I would like to stay with the Barnathan's if they host a student again, and if neither of those families are an option than I would like to live with a family with children.
Sears	Anna	Yes	Yes		I spent two weeks in France when I was a junior in high school, but I have also spent 8 weeks living in Nicaragua with a family while I worked over a summer.	When I was 17, I spent a summer in Nicaragua where I stayed with a host family for 8 weeks. I had never spent so long away from home before, and I had to learn to accomodate to the environment and become a helpful part of the family. It was definitely an adjustment, to live in a room that was not my own and eat food I was not used to eating, but I found that especially through talking in Spanish and just spending time together it becomes a much more natural experience. I think it is important for both the host family and the international student to be open and patient since the benefits of the situation are so huge, and it makes it much easier to form a bond. That experience influences my housing preferences in that I at least feel prepared to enter a home and be a respectful and engaged guest, but I feel like French and Latinamerican cultures are different enough that it makes it hard to draw very many similarities.	I am the youngest of four children- my sister, Lena, is 32 and lives in Seattle where she works as a teacher and raises my niece; my brother, Wayne, is 30 and he is a firefighter in Albuquerque; and my other brother, Kyle, is 23 and he is about to start medical school in the fall. My parents are divorced but both live in Albuquerque, where my father works as a family practice doctor and my mom is an elementary school teacher.	No	Yes	Yes	I think that I am mostly able to take care of myself and can solve my own minor daily problems without much help, but I am also excited for getting to know my family and participating in activities with them. My experiences with roommates have taught me above all else the importance of communication, and so I expect to be communicating with my host family a lot and learning from them. I want to be a good and helpful guest in their home and I think that I am old enough and have enough experience on my own to do that. I see the host family relationship as a huge part of my semester abroad so I am hoping to be somewhere where my presence is valued as well, I want to be open-minded and friendly with each other so that we can each get the most out of our time together.	I have been studying French since I was a sophomore in high school and since the very beginning have been very eager to be fluent. I really enjoy the study of foreign languages because I feel like it gives me a broader perspective on international life and ways of thinking, so that I can be a more understanding person myself. When I came to Wesleyan, I planned my course of study around coming on this program because I knew it would give me the immersion experience I need to finally speak fluently, as well as put me in the middle of French cosmopolitan life so that I could really experience it as a student and a french-speaker. I think that French culture is very interesting, and provides an important contrast to US culture. Modern French attitudes about politics and the rest of the world are something that I would really like to know more about, especially as I progress through my years at Wesleyan.	This spring, I declared my major in Government, and I am also taking classes towards an international relations certificate and a middle eastern studies certificate. I have always been really interested in international politics and organization. I want to go to law or policy school after I graduate, and then hopefully work either for the US state department or another foreign affairs organization to improve resource allocation in third world countries. I have also been studying foreign languages since I was in elementary school, and am currently taking classes in Spanish and Hebrew as well as French.	My main extra-curricular activity is volunteering at a tutoring center for children living in the housing projects that are next to Wesleyan, I spend 4 hours a week at the Traverse Square Center working with elementary school-aged children on their homework and also playing around a bit. Besides that, I spend a lot of time going to movies both at the Wesleyan film series with my friends and at the movie theater in Middletown. I am really into music, especially folk and alternative, and I like to go see my friends who have bands practice or play shows around campus.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	none	Although I do eat all of those foods, I would say that I only eat any kind of meat on occasion. Also I have a mildly sensitive stomach so I sometimes just have plainer meals of pasta or fruit that will not upset me, but in general I can and will eat most things and am looking forward to trying new foods while in France.	No	No, only a slight allergy to rabbits.	I am mostly looking for a housing arrangement where my hosts are open and understanding, especially since my French will need improvement, in terms of communication and our relationship. I want to be in a place where my privacy is respected and I can complete my work, since this semester will be very important for my overall major requirements and completion, and I would like to be not extremely far from where I attend school, even though I am excited about experiencing all of the neighborhoods of Paris. Beyond that, I am excited about the opportunity to live with pretty much any kind of parisian family (especially if it had cats!). I am used to being around children and animals and grew up in a house with lots of siblings so I am looking forward to whatever this experience brings me.	First	Second	
Steiner	Elizabeth	Yes	Yes		I have traveled to France three times: in 1997 for one week, in 2007 for five days, and in 2010 for three days. I have never lived abroad before.	I have never had a home stay experience or hosted an international student.	My parents are married and live together. My father is 67 years old and works as a management consultant. My mother is 60 and works in real estate. I have three siblings: and older half-sister who is 34 and two younger brothers who are twins and both 18 years old. For most of my life, I have lived with my parents and two brothers. I am very close to all members of my family.	No	No	No		I am currently a French major and very interested in French language and literature, so studying abroad fits my interests very well. In addition, during high school I had a French language summer immersion experience at the Middlebury-Monterey Language Academy that I found to be very rewarding because my language level improved so much. I would like to have another immersion experience, albeit this time in a setting where I will be immersed not only in French language but French culture as well.	My primary academic interests are literature and creative writing. I'm also a Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies major at Wesleyan, so I am also interested in anything having to do with Women's Studies/feminism/etc. I have also taken a number of anthropology and art history classes and plan to pursue these academic areas while abroad.	My extracurricular activities at Wesleyan are Rho Epsilon Pi (a sorority, where I am recruitment chair) and ASHA (a sexual health awareness group). I enjoy reading, writing, listening to music, watching independent films, exploring new cities, hanging out with friends, and visiting museums.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes			No	I am slightly allergic to both cats and dogs and would prefer to be in a living situation where there are no pets present.	My main priority with regard to housing is to be as close to the center of the city as possible. I would rather be in the middle of the city than on the outskirts of Paris.	First	Second	As I said previously, I am slightly allergic to animals and would prefer not to be in a situation where animals are not present. My preference would be to live in an apartment where there is a washing machine I would be allowed to use or a living situation where there is a laundromat nearby.
Zaccheo	Giovanni	Yes	Yes		I have never traveled to France. My family lives in Indonesia and I lived in Eritrea for a year when I was 8. I have traveled to many foreign countries.	No, I have not.	My father is the Director of the United Nations Information Center for Indonesia and was previously a senior producer for UNTV in New York. My mother has previously worked as a reporter or editor for numerous publications and is currently unemployed. My parents are both 50 years old. I have one sister, who is fifteen years old and currently a sophomore in high school.	Yes	No	No	I would like to be able to have a living situation where I can cook for myself if I choose, but I don't cook my own food very often. I lived alone during my last experience with an independent living situation and often felt lonely, so it would help me to be able to live with a family.	I have never been to Paris before and I'm very interested in discovering its particular urban culture. Other than practicing and perfecting my spoken French and being immersed in the French university system, my primary motivations for coming to Paris are cultural, and I intend to explore as much of Paris' urban landscape as possible.	I'm an English major, so I'm mostly interested in literature and analytic writing. I don't have much experience with creative writing, but I am interested in continuing to improve my creative writing skills and developing my personal style and voice.	I'm on the varsity fencing team at Vassar, so practice takes up a lot of my time outside of class. Apart from fencing, I enjoy seeing live music, reading, and listening to and writing hip hop.	Regular smoker	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes				I am allergic to cats and I don't like dogs.	If possible, I would like to be in a walkable and lively neighborhood. Proximity to Reid Hall is also a concern for me, as I often run late during commutes.	First	Second	I would prefer not to live with animals or young children. I am usually fairly neat but I'm not fastidious and I can often take a while to clean messes in my room. I prefer to stay up late and sleep in when possible, and I often do schoolwork very late at night.
