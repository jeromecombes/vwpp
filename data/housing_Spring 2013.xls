Aybar	Melissa	No	Yes		I've never been to France. I studied abroad in Egypt for a summer. I also travel to, and have lived in Dominican Republic.	Yes, I stayed with a host family in Egypt. It wasn't the most positive experience which is why a colocation is my first choice, but I wouldn't be opposed to a new experience with a host family in an entirely different culture and for a longer amount of time.	I live with my mother and my 9 yr. old brother, Brian, in Boston, MA. My father lives in Dominican Republic, along with the other half of my family. I am super close to my family and have lots of cousins I treat as my own siblings. There are a bunch of babies in my family so I'm sad I have to miss out on them!  - We live in an apartment, spanish is our first language, and I am a first generation college student. Fun factoid, we're all really tall.	No	Yes	Yes	I have never had my own place, but I have lived with roommates and have cooked for myself living on my own. This doesn't necessarily influence my housing decision but I have never had issues with my roommates (when I did choose them and when I didn't) and if I have to make meals I can do that.	I want to improve my french, I want to go abroad for a semester to experience something other than Amherst as an educational experience, and I just want to see other places in the world. I am interested in seeing another culture, and making myself a part of it for the time I am there.	Although my majors are not indication of that I am most interested in law/policy changes. Mostly things that have to do with social change. I'm a psychology major because I've been able to learn a lot about people's behaviors - what changes them and what causes them.	I do a lot of literacy work on campus. I started my own special needs facility, I mentor and tutor and just participate in a lot of activities surrounding education. I also plan the events that happen on campus - like concerts and speakers and campus-wide activities. I also do a lot of the recruiting for students of color on campus and my internships have all revolved round non-profit work.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	none	none		no	I think one of my main issues with hosting in Egypt was the space between my host family and I. They weren't super talkative or willing to communicate as often as I'd like yet I had little independence and feel like I missed out on a lot because I wasn't able to communicate and get out as much as I would have hoped. For example, I couldn't go running for as long as I wanted or skip out on certain things to attend events. So, I think being able to explore is important to me and I would love for my host family to understand that. So, independence is my concern.	First	Second	I love kids and I love dogs so I'm not opposed to either. In fact, kids are encouraged!  - I would also love to be closer to downtown Paris but thats just a dream not really my most important concern.
Bonneau	Alyssa		Yes		In the spring of 2010 I spent about ten days in Strasbourg doing a home-stay through my high school.	My family has hosted two French students, one of whom was part of my high school's exchange program. One of the students had spent a lot of time in America, and the other student (my exchange student) has never been to America before. I then spent approximately ten days at my student's house in a small town near Strasbourg. She had two younger brothers, and I really enjoyed getting to know her family. However being in a small town, it was very difficult to explore on my own or without a car. While I enjoyed being temporarily part of her family, I would really prefer being in a location where I could easily get around by myself.	My mother is a grade school teacher and my father has a computer consulting company and works at home. I have one older sister, but she no longer lives at home. We have always had pets, although right now we only have one dog. My family really enjoys cooking, and we often have meals together at least once a day.	Yes	Yes	Yes	I think I could easily adapt to a new family-living situation, however I am also very comfortable with more autonomy.	I have been studying french for a very long time, and I have always wanted to spend an extended period of time in France to help develop my language skills. I also want to experience French culture, which is something that can only truly be done by spending an extended period of time in France. I really enjoyed traveling to France as a high school student, although it was such a short time that I hardly experienced it.	I am a double major in French and Government. I am very interested in politics, both academically and otherwise. I also really like studying history and literature, although I have not had many opportunities to do so thus far.	Most of my extra-curricular activities at Wesleyan are centered around political and social activism. I also really enjoy movies, and I try to go to as many concerts as possible.	Occasional smoker	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes			Yes		I am most concerned with living in a central location that is easily accessible by public transit.	First	Second	I have always had pets, and do not mind being placed in a house with pets. I would also not mind living in a house with small children, although I would not want to be a care-taker.
Centofanti	Kate	Yes	Yes		I have traveled in France and Italy for 10 days each, and have been to multiple islands in the Caribbean for a week or 2 weeks each		My mother is a psychiatrist and my father was a chemical engineer but is currently retired. My 18-year-old brother is a freshman at Connecticut College	Yes	Yes	Yes	I think that it will make it much easier for me to adapt to multiple living situations, because I can be very independent and fend for myself, but I also enjoy living with people, so no matter the situation I am placed into I feel that I would be able to assimilate.	I want to improve my active skills (speaking and writing), and I also want to learn more about the culture because I plan on becoming a French teacher after I graduate from Wesleyan, and I feel that experiencing what I hope to teach is extremely important.	I am majoring in Psychology, French, and also getting the Education Certificate.	Volleyball, cooking (mostly baking), frisbee and singing.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes			No	No	I want to be within the city and not in a suburb. I would also love to have children in the house, age is irrelevant.	First	Second	I love kids and animals, my interests (as also stated above) include volleyball, frisbee, baking and singing, I am neat but not the neatest, I usually study in my bedroom but I am not loud or disruptive, I usually do not make that much noise and I tend to go to sleep a little on the later side but I can adjust this very easily to accommodate any family.
Chan	Alda	Yes	Yes		I have never lived in a country other than the United States.  The only other nation I have been to is Canada, and that was for about a week.	No I have not.	I have a very open relationship with my mother, father, who are in their 50's, and my brother who is 24 years old.  My mother works as a bank clerk at Bank of China, my father works with my uncle in their own business; and my brother is a college graduate with a double major in physics and astronomy.  My family is the type that eats a home-cooked dinner together every night, goes through some of the most vicious arguments, or can just be plain silly with one another.  In the end, we all know that we will always be there for each other.	No	No	No		As a French major who has not yet been to France, I believe that studying abroad will bring my knowledge, fluency, and love of this language to levels higher than those I can ever reach by simply staying at an American institution to continue my studies.  Studying abroad in Paris will allow me to completely immerse myself in the great French culture to not only increase my confidence and improve my skills in the use of French, but also provide me with an experience in authentic French habits and ways of life.  I can never truly envelop a language unless I understand the life and origins behind it.  I decided to choose the Paris program over other French study abroad programs because growing up in NYC, I love fashion and a bustling city life--Paris has both of those.  I cannot wait to wake up in the morning and simply have to walk down the street to find a cafe to grab an authentic croissant for a great start to a day filled with improving my French and exploring my place in the Parisian culture.	French has always been a language I studied since I was a seventh grader in middle school.  Now, becoming a junior in college, I have spent eight years of my life embracing this romance language.  I realized my affinity for this language as soon as I started looking forward to the new topics of vocabulary I would be learning during my next class sessions, so i never hesitated to continue taking French courses as I proceeded through my academic years.  In the beginning of my sophomore year at Amherst College, I decided to concentrate on studying French, so I declared it as one of my majors (the other being Law, Jurisprudence, and Social Thought).	Outside of class, I am a Diversity Intern, a Campus Center Manager/Event Intern, a Vice Chair for the Amherst College Social Council, a member and choreographer in Amherst Dance, a volunteer for Horizons for Homeless Children, and a participant in Habitat for Humanity.  I love taking up various extra-curricular activities because I want to acquire a wide range of skills.  Being a Diversity Intern, I represent Amherst College as I work directly for the Admissions Office in in providing guidance and information for prospective students.  Both the Event Intern and Social Council positions involve creating and planning multiple campus-wide events per month for the college's students.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes			Yes	I have seasonal allergies, but they usually only act up during the summer.  My nose is a little sensitive to dust though.	I worry that the family will not be as welcoming as I would like or that I end up becoming an annoyance.  My main priority is to have a warm host family who will help me immerse in their culture while I try my best to bring something new and exciting to them.	First	Second	I prefer neat surroundings.  As for my study habits, I cannot work if there is too much noise around me.  I also tend to stay up late (2am) if I need to finish assignments or if I have a big test the next day.
Dellplain	Melanie	Yes	Yes		In the summer of 2008, I lived in India for one month. This included a homestay for three of the four weeks. I haven't lived in any other country, but I have traveled to France three times: once for a week with my family in Paris, once for a week to visit my sister in Paris (who was studying abroad there at the time), and once on a class trip for two weeks in Nice with my 8th grade French class.	Like I mentioned above, I stayed with a family in India for three weeks. This was my least favorite part of the trip. There were four members of the family: a mother, father, and two children around the ages of 11 and 13 I believe. While they were nice and generous to allow me to stay with them, they never gave me any space. Literally the only moment I was ever alone was when I was in the bathroom. They didn't let me nap or do anything by myself, which is something I really value, and were just very loud and intrusive in general. The kids always wanted to play with me, and while this was fun at first, like I just said, I like having time alone. As for hosting an international student, my family hosted an exchange student from Japan for a year, who was also a friend of the family. He had his own room, life, and friends, so we just saw him at meals, when he was hanging around our house, and when we'd all go out together. I liked this setup a lot - it was nice getting to know him, but not being forced to spend a lot of time with him. Because of these experiences, I want a homestay that gives me a lot of independence. I would strongly prefer to not have any children of any age in the house, but I would enjoy spending some time with my host parents and getting to know them. Again though, I want to stress that I want to be able to have privacy and independence.	My dad is a graphic designer and a furniture designer and my mom works in human resources at an online travel company. I have one sister who is two years older than me, and she currently is at graduate school studying public health. We're a really tight-knit family.	Yes	Yes	Yes	I currently live in an on-campus apartment with one roommate. We cook occasionally, but mostly go out to eat. It doesn't really influence my current preference for housing in Paris, since I recognize that any comparable living situation in Paris (in an apartment with a roommate) would be very different from here. My roommate is one of my best friends here and I already knew her really well before we chose to live together, and this wouldn't be the case in Paris. While I'm open to living in an apartment there, again, I can't really draw from my current living situation and apply it to my living situation in Paris.	I want to improve my French and live in a large, thriving city.	I'm a Psychology and French Studies double major, so I've mostly taken classes in those areas. However, I really enjoy taking courses in a wide variety of fields and getting a taste for a completely unfamiliar subject, so I take a fair number of introductory science and humanities classes as well.	I enjoy photography, watching movies, exercising, and spending time with friends and family.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Shellfish	Nothing in particular	Yes	I've recently become allergic to cats, but it doesn't seem to be a strong allergy, so living somewhere without a cat would be preferable but not essential.	I don't want to live in a homestay with any other children or students of any age - I don't want to be with kids, teenagers/older children still living at home, or other students studying abroad.	First	Second	Like I said, I don't want to live with children. I like dogs a lot and would like living with a dog, but also don't feel a strong need to live with one. I'd rather not live with a cat. I would also really like to live somewhere quiet (low noise both in the apartment and in the streets/surrounding area).
Demelier	Adrien	No	Yes		I have traveled to France every other year for about 2 weeks at a time. I have just recently moved to Switzerland, we have lived there for little more then 4 months.	I have never had a home stay experience witha foreign family or hosted an international student.	I have a large family. I have 3 brothers, they are 18, 15 and 12. My mom works from home and my dad works as a CEO at Bayer Pharmaceutical.	No	No	No	I have not had this experience	I have 3 principal reasons for coming to France.  - 1) I want to improve my language skills. Going to France will be instrumental in boosting my french writing and speaking.  - 2) I want to learn more about my birth place. I was born in France and I feel french but I don't know anything about my city. I think the best way to get this experience is too live in France for a while. - 3) Vassar College is offering a once in a lifetime opportunity to learn in another country and participate in a new culture and I want to take this opportunity.	My main academic interest is economics. I am an economics major. I also want to be a French correlate. I hope I can take economics classes while I am in Paris.	I am on the soccer team so I spend a huge amount of time going to practice and games. I hope that in France I'll be able to keep playing. A part from soccer I love to cook and hope I can learn a little bit more in France.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	none	none		I am a little allergic to cats but I can usually deal with it. I also have seasonal allergies in the Fall.	I can't see the essential housing information, my password isn't working. I am open to a lot of different types of housing.	First	Second	
Dorsey	Emily	Yes	Yes		I have never lived in a foreign country. - I have only traveled in France once, I was in Paris for four days. - I have traveled for a week or less in each of the following locations: England, Italy, Spain, Greece, Honduras, Panama, Costa Rica, Mexico, Belize, the French West Indies (St. Barths). - I spent two weeks in Ecuador.	No	My mother and father are married and I have two sisters. - My father works in finance in Manhattan, dealing with investment risk management. - My mother was a nurse and social worker and now works for a medical software company. - My older sister just graduated and is living in Manhattan working as a legal analyst. - My younger sister is still in high school at the Berkshire school which is a boarding school in Massachusetts.	Yes	Yes	Yes	I think living in an apartment with a roommate has prepared me to be comfortable in living situations that can be both communal and very independent, as are the living situations with WVPP.	French is one of my majors. I love languages but I have always been the most passionate about French. After having loved the language and culture for so long, I feel it is essential to live in Paris and experience it first hand.	French literature and French poetry, and sociology.	Singing- formal choirs, a cappella, gospel. - Working and volunteering with non-profit organizations that provide supportive services to people who are homeless, unemployed, substance dependent, or mentally ill.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None	None	No	None	I want to become involved in the city and the community around me, so it is important to me that I live in one of the central areas within Paris where a lot is going on.

Dowling	Emily	Yes	Yes		I traveled to Paris from July 5, 2001 to July 13, 2001. I also traveled to the Bahamas for a week in 2005 and Italy for a week in 2007, where I visited Milan, Florence, and Venice.	I have not.	My mother is an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA. She is 46 years old. My father is a high school AP physics teachers, and he is 47 years old. I have one sister who is currently 17 and is a senior in high school.	No	No	No	Since I have never had an independent, non-dormitory style living situation before, I am looking forward to living with a host family so that I can interact and get to know others in my new home.	I have been studying French for about six years, but I still have a great deal of difficulty with speaking and writing and often feel nervous trying to communicate with others in French. I believe than study abroad will be the best and most enriching way for me to improve my French abilities because I will be immersed in academic study, cultural activities, and social interactions that take place in French. I have also had limited experiences in other countries, and I would like to live in Paris so that I can learn about and experience another culture. When I visited Paris as a child, I was mesmerized by all of the history and culture that I saw around me, but I was not yet old enough to really appreciate all of the food, art, theatre, and other cultural elements to which I was exposed. Now, I hope to be able to experience all of these elements by immersing myself in French language, history, culture, and daily life.	I am an English major with a main focus in modern and postmodern American literature. I am also very interested in French history, specifically contemporary French history, and classical French literature; I am currently pursuing a correlate in French. I am also very passionate about history, especially European and Middle Eastern history.	At school, I participate in an extra-curricular dance company that is centered around student choreography and performs a variety of modern, jazz, and hip-hop pieces. Outside of class, I also tutor middle school students in all subjects and guide them through activities such as cooking and art. I am also a part of Hunger Action, which is a very active community service organization on campus that focuses on issues of hunger and homelessness in the local community and the nation. In my leisure time, I love to read and write creatively, and I also take a variety of yoga and pilates classes.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None	None	Yes	I do not.	I don't really have a central concern, but I would prefer to live with a host family that would really like to engage and interact with me; I would like to be involved with the family I live with on a daily basis. I want to For this reason, it would be nice to stay with a family who has children, preferably close to my age, with whom I could speak and interact.	First	Second	I tend to study late at night, so I would like to live with a family that wouldn't be bothered if I worked and went to bed late. I would like to live with a family that has a child, preferably an older child, but I am also happy to live with a family that has younger children. I would prefer not to live with a family that has a dog. I am relatively neat, and would be willing to follow any guidelines about neatness and cleanliness established by my host family.
Elbaum	Emma	Yes	Yes		Before coming to Vassar, I participated in an yearlong exchange program in Switzerland, where I lived with a host family.  More recently, I lived in Haiti for two months at a grassroots organization's training center compound.	In Switzerland, I had a homestay, originally with a single mother, which was not successful and ultimately changed host families part way through the program.  I also stayed with a host family in rural Nicaragua while participating in a service learning trip last spring. From these experiences, I feel that a colocation with other French students would suit me better than a stay with a traditional family.  Also, as I am older than I was the last time that I did a long-term homestay, I think I would appreciate the freedom of a colocation more than the camaraderie of a traditional homestay.	My mother is an accountant and my father is the director of a classical music hall.  My sister is 17 and currently a freshman at Vassar.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Currently, I live in a co-op with eight other people, only one of which I had met prior to moving in.  We cook house meals five nights a week but the rest of our food is on our own.  I've really enjoyed the independence associated with this style of living and think that it will work even better on a smaller scale (i.e. only a few roommates).  As such, a colocation in Paris would not only be more enjoyable for me, but also be an easier transition from my current living situation.	I am coming to Paris because I want to experience French culture first-hand.  I am hoping that my time there will be as close to that of a Parisian student but I understand that as an American student, it won't be identical.  Furthermore, I would like to continue exploring the issues surrounding food and agriculture which I have been studying this semester as part of the Multidisciplinary Living-Learning Community, but in a Francophone context.	My main academic interest is anthropology, especially cultural and biological anthropology.  Most recently though, my academics have been on the subject of food, studying it from the perspectives of biology, anthropology, and geography.	In my free time, I play A-side for the rugby team, hike, snowboard, cook and bake, read, and watch movies.  I also play the oboe and saxophone but will not be bringing my instruments to France.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None.	None.	No	No.	My priority regarding housing is that, wherever I am, there are clear lines of communication if ever a problem should arise.	Second	First	I really like animals (my house is keeping chickens this semester) and would be happy in a house with pets.  As far as children go, I would really rather not live with children under 10 or 12.  My main interests are food, outdoor activities (such as hiking and snowboarding) and music.  I usually go to bed no later than 1 or 2 and wake up around 7 or 7:30.
Esocoff	Sarah	Yes	Yes		I have traveled in France and Italy.  I went to France for one week in 2009 and Italy for one week in 2011.	No.	I live with my mother, father, and brother.  My father is a sports television director.  My mother is primarily a stay-at-home mother, but she also works part-time as a life coach and a substitute teacher.  My brother Reid is seventeen years old.	No	No	No		My major requires that I study abroad.  Like most, I am coming to Paris to become proficient in French, gain a better understanding of the French culture, and to better understand my own culture.	I am a College of Letters major, so I am interested in the humanities, especially philosophy.  I am interested in many types of writing, including nonfiction, poetry, and humor.  I also study painting.	I write for the Ampersand, Wesleyan's humor publication, and sing in Slavei, the Eastern-European music a capella group.  I do a lot of reading, writing, drawing, and picture-taking. I also sail.	No	No	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes	No	No			No		My principle priority is being in a central location.	First	Second	
Kaufman	Michael	Yes	Yes		I have traveled to Canada and to Italy, but these visits were only two weeks long and I stayed in hotels with my family.	I have never had a home stay experience.	My brothers are both seniors in high school and while we're pretty close we usually keep to ourselves around the house and do our own thing.  My dad is a Senior counselor for the electronic company gamestop and my mom is an elementary school librarian.  We like to playfully make fun of each other a lot.  We usually have family dinners on the weekends.	Yes	Yes	Yes	It has made me realize that I'd like to live in a clean house.  By that, I mean that everyone is a relatively neat person who keeps their space clean and tidies up after themselves.	I would really like to become fluent in French.  In addition I want to taste (and hopefully learn how to make) some authentic french cuisine.  Other than that, I'd like to absorb the culture as much as possible and learn from all the sites and sounds around me.	While I'm majoring in cognitive science at Vassar, I'd like to branch out a little while in Paris.  I've interested in French literature, especially poetry.  I am also considering taking some sociology, music and film courses while abroad.	My two main ones are music and exercise.  I go to the gym everyday and I try to read up on workout techniques etc.  My other big extracurricular activity is music.  I play guitar (and dabble in a few other instruments), I run my own music blog and I like to attend concerts regularly to stay in the music scene loop.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes			Yes	My only allergy I have that I can physically notice is my allergy to dust mites.  This is only an issue if the house I'm living in is very dusty.	I would like to live with someone/people who keep a clean house and who are willing to be engaging and have some fun, but will also give me space when I need it.  Also, I'd love to live with someone who knows how to cook and is eager to teach me a few tricks.	First	Second	I wouldn't mind living with other children in the apartment, especially ones my own age (though I'm not opposed to being the only kid in the house).  I also don't mind pets, though I'd prefer if there were none.  Since I'm into music, I'd love a family that felt the same way and maybe even played instruments themselves.  I'd also keep my stuff very clean and neat and organized and I'd like a family that does the same.  I usually try to get my work done right after school so that I'm free by the late evening/night time to relax and as long as I have my own room that isn't barged into, I can easily do my work while others go about their business around the house/apartment.  Noise doesn't really bother me in general as long as it's not in my room and I can easily fall asleep with it (though I'm easily woken in the morning by noise).  If left to my own devices, I usually go to bed around 1/1:30 and wake up around 9-10:00.  Therefore, I'd prefer a family with a similar schedule, or at least a family that doesn't mind me being up until 1.
Kornfeld	Molly	Yes	Yes		No	No	My mother is a comedian and my father is a freelance writer. My parents are separated but when we're home, my sister and I stay with my mother during the week and my father during the weekends. My sister is 18 years old and is currently a freshman at Bard college. Even though my parents are no longer together, we are an extremely close family.	No	No	No	I have never lived in an independent living situation.	I have never left the country and I would love to see Paris. It is one of the most beautiful and romantic cities in the world and I can't wait to explore it! I am also incredibly interested in fashion and I want to be exposed to Parisian couture.	My main academic interests are Economics, English, and French.	In my free time I  like to read, write, sing, and watch movies. I am also very interested in fashion and at school, I am a member of the campus's fashion publication.	No		No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes				No	I am allergic to cats and dust.	I want to be able to spend time with and get along with the people I am living with. At the same time, I am a very independent person and I really want to explore Paris while I am there. I don't want to be in a situation where I don't have as much freedom.	First	Second	Even though I am prepared to live in any region of Paris, I would love to live in the center of the city. Also, I tend to go to bed late, sleep in, and I enjoy playing music in my room. I don't mind children or animals and I am a little messy.
Kosman	Hannah	Yes	Yes		Yes. I have been to France and other European countries several times with my family. My parents and I lived in Paris for two weeks, and I've spent up to three or four weeks traveling around France and England (London and elsewhere), and shorter periods of time in Spain, Germany, Portugal, Holland, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy.	No.	I have older half siblings who were out of the house by the time I was born, so growing up it was just my parents and I. My Mother and Father are both college professors (although my Father is now retired) and are respectively in their 60s and 70s.

I am also a competent cook so I will always be able to "fend for myself" if I can't eat what my host family is eating.	Yes	Mild cat allergy.	I just don't want to be an inconvenience to anyone -- I would hate to feel like a burden to the family I was staying with!	First	Second	I'm generally a very neat person who likes to be sociable but also likes to work and sleep in quiet. I tend to go to bed relatively early and wake up relatively early but have gotten used to doing so quietly after two years of living with a college roommate.  -  - I'm fond of children and animals (despite some allergies to certain members of the latter group).  -  - I am Jewish but am very ready and willing to be flexible about my traditional observances when abroad, so not sure if it has any effect.
Kudman	Zachary	Yes	Yes		I was born in Copenhagen, lived there for first 3 months of my live. I have since traveled to France twice (once staying with a host family in Rouen as part of a high school exchange program for approx 10 days). I have also traveled to Germany, Italy, England, Canada, the Caribbean.	Lived with French host family in Rouen for 10 days in high school, hosted French students both freshman and junior years of high school for approx two weeks each time. Really loved all three experiences and it made me feel more confident using French with native speakers. Having already lived in France for a short period, I feel like I would prefer to have a more independent living situation in Paris.	I have two younger brothers (aged 17 and 14). My mother is currently going back to school but has not worked since I was born. My father works in Information Systems for a shipping corporation named Sealed Air. My family has never had much discipline and my siblings and I have always been able to make our own decisions within the house as long as they are reasonable.	No	Yes	No	Living with a roommate made me realize that I really prefer having my own personal space where I can unwind/relax without fear of interference. In Paris it would be very important for me to have my own room/personal space.	Beautiful city and I want my French language skills to approach/reach a level of fluency. I also find French culture very agreeable. Additionally, I want the experience of living in a foreign country because I believe it is an excellent opportunity for personal growth and discovery.	I am a Political Science major and Economics correlate. I am also very interested in philosophy/history/literature and have recently fostered an additional interest in music.	I am currently on the rugby team but would not consider myself an athlete or as having any great interests in athletics. My primary interest right now is music and I try to play the guitar for a few hours every day when possible. I also enjoy reading, writing, cooking (very occasionally) and certain outdoor activities such as taking walks, hiking, swimming, etc...	Occasional smoker	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	No	No		Not necessarily customs but my family is very health-conscious and we try to make conscious decisions in regards to our food (organic when possible, lots of produce, minimal if any sweets/desserts).	Yes	Not that I am aware of.	My principal concern is that I will feel constrained in my comings/goings because of the need to accommodate my host family. Thus my biggest priority regarding housing is that I will be free to live (relatively) independently and will not feel that I am disturbing others.	Second	First	I play the guitar essentially every day and greatly desire a housing situation which can accommodate that. I also consider myself a "night person" and go to sleep relatively late. Additionally, if possible, I would prefer to be as centrally located within Paris as is permitted within the limitations of the available options.
Liu	Xi	No	Yes		I am an international student, so the US is a foreign country that I traveled/lived in. Duration: 3 years so far.	Yes, I have previously had home stay experience in England and the US. Both were very nice experiences. My hosts took an effort to get to know me and worked to incorporate me into their daily lives. I felt like part of the family during my American home stay.  -  - Therefore, I look forward to my home stay experience in Paris. From my previous experience I learned that I am very flexible in terms of living habits/food/living conditions. I care more about the family atmosphere and the communication among family members. As I am not a very talkative person myself, I would benefit tremendously from a lively and out-going host, who is willing to initiate conversations and is interested in communicating with foreign students. That said, I will make every effort on my part to involve actively in the family life.	My father is a college professor and my mother is an editor in an professional magazine. I live with both of my parents in an apartment in down town Nanjing, China. I am the only child in the family.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Again, they made me pretty flexible in terms of tolerating/adapting to other people's living habit. -  - I usually get along with my roommates quite well. Although I am not particularly out-going and talkative, but once open up, I am also fun to talk with.Thus, I think I will especially benefit from an out going host who loves to communicate and is willing to include me in her activities. -  - I enjoy cooking and cooks good Chinese food. I would like to try fixing some meals for my host if she enjoys it.	I would like to perfect my language skills and get to know a foreign culture by fully emerging myself in it.Therefore, I believe that home stay experience will be an essential part of my semester abroad since it creates a great way to talk to ordinary French people and get to know their lives.	My majors are Psychology and Economics. I am also interested in humanity subjects such as history, philosophy and theater.	I love to watch movies on my leisure. I also used to sing in a high school choir, and really enjoyed the experience. I love music and love to sing.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None	I am pretty flexible in terms of eating. I am willing to try out all different kinds of food and often end up liking them.	No	No. I am very flexible in terms of pets.	I want as much communication with the host as possible, so it would be nice if the host has an outgoing personality and is open to new ideas.	First	Second	I like to cook. - I am not particularly an early riser.
Martino	Nicholas	Yes	Yes		I have never lived in a foreign country. The longest I have ever been to Europe was 2 weeks in London.	n/a	My mom and dad are currently separated, in the middle of a divorce whose details they're keeping fairly distant from me. At home, my dad works at a brewery in northern Wisconsin and is in Stevens Point, WI for Tues-Thurs. When he's home he shares weekends at home with my mom, they trade back and forth every week with the other parent staying with a friend. All the same they're both phenomenal parents and very involved in my life. My mom is a part-time infusion nurse at a local hospital and works days 3-4 times a week. My dad is 61 and my mom is 59. I have a 15 year old sister. She's sort of a trouble maker; and like a lot of teenagers going thru puberty fights with my parents on and off. Adopted from Bulgaria.	No	No	No		I look forward to living in a foreign county because I believe shifting my environment so radically will foster strong and profound realizations about myself and how I view the world. An immersive new culture will allow me to cast off my unconscious notions and influences that living in the US gives me and be able to better define who I am. Living in a country on my own will surely strengthen my character, I will be able to strengthen my skills in a language I love as well.	I am a COL major and like that sort of stuff: literature, philosophy, religion. I love writing poetry and russian literature classes. I speak Chinese and French.	I really enjoy acting and being in musicals. In a lot of my free time I hang out with friends; alone I read, take walks, sing and listen to music, play guitar and write.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	I am allergic to seafood (but mildly and enjoy it in moderation).	I practice guitar often and sing quite a lot with music. I take walks, usually at night.	Yes	Nope!	I want to live in Paris/in a place where the city is easily accessible and with a friendly and welcoming family	First	Second	I stay up late, don't mind smokers, burn candles and prefer neatness. Listen to a lot of music but not particularly loudly.An apartment with cats/dogs would be AWESOME
Murray	Erin	Yes	Yes		No, I have never left the United States before.	No.	I lived the majority of my life with my older sister and mother. My mother is an administrative police officer and my older sister, 24, is a recent graduate of The School of Visual Arts in New York City. Growing up with a single mother, I have been living in an independent manner for most of my life. I have been financially independent since I was 16, paying for all of my schooling, bills, and most other things. My sister graduated high school and moved out when I was 14 and since my mother works fulltime, I am used to cooking, cleaning, and generally looking after myself. I have also had a variety of animals over my life and have enjoyed the experience of owning each one.	Yes	Yes	Yes	I would honestly be more comfortable in a "colocation." I have been living on my own since graduating high school and did not have much of a close knit family life before that, so I find living with an established family unit or couple a little uneasy. Cooking is also one of my favorite things to do, and I would be very sad in a household where I could not prepare all of my own meals.	I am an International Studies major with a French minor. I am fascinated by the interaction of national governments and organizations and would love to see how these interactions are represented outside of the U.S. I have also been studying French for 3 years now and am ready to try to put it to use in every day life, as I am sure that will also help cement my knowledge of the language.	I am an International Studies major with focuses in History and Sociology, though the classes I take in Sociology are probably more accurately labeled Anthropology. My main area of interest is food and its cultural and political connotations. For example, the class I am currently the most fascinated with is Food, Culture, and Globalization where I study the ramifications of Western food introduced into other diets and the advertising techniques that made foods such as dairy milk ubiquitous in households.	I am a member of Vassar College's only all-female sketch and stand-up comedy group, Indecent Exposure. I have written articles for student publications in the past. I went to a performing and visual arts academy for high school, and still act and dance. I enjoy photography and take pride in developing my own film and prints. I've also spent almost a decade as a technical theatre student, so I take pride in my carpentry, electrical, and painting skills.	Occasional smoker	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No.	No.	No	No.	I am a rather private person and have lived most of my life under my own supervision. I am uneasy about learning and following rules in an established household because I have not done so regularly in the past. One of my main concerns with housing is my ability to prepare and cook food for myself. Cooking is one of my favorite activities and I find it very soothing. Having a kitchen I can use multiple times a day would mean a lot to me. This is why an apartment appeals to me more than the room in a household. I also recognize that France is more liberal than America, but I want to note that I wish to live with someone with open views toward sexuality so that my choice of partner and participation in LGBTQ organizations in the city is not a point of contention.	First	Second	
Nguyen	John	Yes	Yes		No. I have never traveled to a foreign country.	No.	My family includes my father and stepmother, my step-grandparents, and my younger brother (7 years). My father is an engineer and my stepmother is a nail stylist. They work long hours, and I frequently took my meals late at night when they got back, or prepared my own food.	No	No	Yes	Though I have never lived independently before, I have stayed in the dormitories at Vassar over the summer and prepared my own meals for myself, and so am used to cooking on my own. I would appreciate living in a home with a well-equipped kitchen, and one which is reasonably quiet.	I am coming to Paris to study and to form connections, as well as to immerse myself in the culture. It is very important to me that I get the most out of my term at the Parisian university where I study, as well as my experiences with the city itself.	I am double-majoring in Philosophy, and French and Francophone studies. Philosophy is my main academic passion, and I am especially interested in being exposed to the French pedagogical style of teaching philosophy, as well as its emphasis on the Continental school of thought, as opposed to the American fixation on Analytic philosophy. I am also interested in history and the other social sciences.	I am a member of Vassar's diving team, and will be seeking out opportunities to dive while in Paris. I practice Mixed Martial arts, Tai Chi, and Tomiki Aikido, and am also an avid runner. I have also been involved in programming and robotics in the past, and I enjoy games of strategy such as Go and chess. I also write for Vassar's student newspaper, and am interested in pursuing a career in publishing and journalism after graduation.	No	No	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	No	No	None	None	Yes	I am allergic to cats.	I would prefer being placed in a home which is more quiet, and does not have young children in it. I would also appreciate being placed in a home with professionals of some sort or another.	First	Second	I tend to sleep early, around 23:00, and wake up early to do work and study. I am a light sleeper, though I love animals, and I am a quite neat person. I tend to like to be alone while doing my work, though I tend to work during the evenings and mornings and enjoy having other people around during the afternoons.
Orchant	Danielle	Yes	Yes		I have not ever lived in a foreign county before. I traveled to France minimally on two separate occasions, once spending 4 days in Paris and once spending 2 days in Nice. I've also traveled to Italy and Japan.	I have not ever had a home stay experience or hosted an international student.	I have two parents (a mom and dad), aged 50 and 53. My mom works as a private college counselor and my dad worked for a long time as an executive recruiter but is now retired. My brother is 23 and graduated from Bard College in 2011. He worked at PIRG in Oregon and now works in New Jersey as an SAT tutor. He plans to apply to law school this year. We also have a dog and two cats, and I would to live with pets while I'm abroad.	No	Yes	No	I have lived with roommates all three years at Bowdoin, and went to sleep-away camp for 8 summers (7 weeks each summer), where I shared a room with up at 16 other girls. I am used to sharing a room with others, but do prefer to have some private space. I have not had too much experience cooking for myself, but can cook basics and am looking forward to improving!	My principal reason for coming to Paris is language immersion, followed by cultural immersion. I feel that studying in Paris at this time in my life is a unique opportunity to progress in my language skills dramatically, while learning first-hand about French culture as well. I am also looking forward to experiencing living in a big city in another country; I live outside of New York City, so I am used to the "big city feel", but am interested in comparing and contrasting that with my time in Paris.	I am Africana Studies major, and within that, am primarily interested in African American studies and the francophone Caribbean. I am also interested in French as a discipline--particularly through francophone culture and literature. Lastly, I am interested in philosophy and education. Most of my courses at Bowdoin have centered on these four disciplines and their intersections.	I do a lot of volunteer work, which comprise the bulk of my leisure time. I work with prisoners long-distance on courses that they take through a local non-profit; I am a trained advocate for Bowdoin students who have experienced sexual violence; I volunteer at an organization that helps low-income Mainers with civil law problems; and I am part of an organization called Africa Alliance, which helps Bowdoin students to connect over a common interest in Africana studies. When I am just hanging out, I love to watch movies, read, and catch up with my friends.	No	No	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes	No	No	tomatoes	n/a	Yes	No, I would love to live with pets!	My principal concern is that my host family will be able to accommodate my dietary needs (vegetarian + tomato allergy), and will take them seriously. I would also really like to have a family/person who is committed to helping me improve my language skills, but who is not overbearing and will allow me a degree of independence.	First	Second	I would absolutely love to live with pets (particularly dogs or cats). I am happy to live with children, but am fine without them as well. I have trouble studying with a lot of noise, and will probably want to study in my room a fair amount. I also suspect that I will Skype in my bedroom from time to time.
Parks	Katherine		Yes		I have traveled to France twice. I was in Paris for 3 days in 2007. In 2011, I spent 4 days in the Loire Valley and 3 days in Paris.	No.	I live with both of my parents and a younger sister. My mother works in an elementary school and my father works in finance and travels often. My sister is 15 and we are very close.	No	No	No	I am not worried about a new living situation. I more concerned about cooking for myself. Hopefully between now and then, I can develop some more skills or my host family can teach me.	I am very interested in arts and culture and Paris is the best place to experience those things. Also, I am looking forward to living in a big city.	I am a College of Letters and Music double major. I am very interested in French history and music. I also like art and architecture.	I am in an a cappella group and I make a lot of music in my free time. I am also very involved in theater.	No	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None	I do not eat seafood.	No	No	I am a fairly independent person, so I would like to live with people who can be my surrogate family, while also having the freedom to be a young person in Paris.	First	Second	It would be fun to be placed with someone who is interested in music. I have no preference in regards to children or animals.
Parlak	Duygu Vivian	No	Yes		I have never lived in France, but I traveled to Paris three times with my family for vacation. I am currently doing an exchange program in Bologna, Italy (for 5 months).	I have had several short home stay experiences with foreign families, while I was traveling around Europe, doing youth exchange programs. The families I stayed with were all very welcoming and they made me feel comfortable. They would involve me in their daily lives, offering breakfast/dinner, asking me about my day etc. They would also respect my privacy and give me my personal space, which I greatly appreciated. In Paris, I would like to live with a small family, preferably with no small kids.	I don't have any siblings. I lived with my mom and dad until I started high school. My dad is a medical doctor and my mom is currently a professor at a university. I lived in a dorm for 3 years at my high school, then lived in an apartment for 2 years.	Yes	Yes	Yes	I would rather not have roommates, and I would rather cook for myself.	I am fascinated by the French language, hoping to become fluent by the end of the semester. I would like to do a graduate program in France after graduating from Vassar.	I am studying economics with a correlate in French and Italian. I am interested particularly in international finance.	I like meditative practices, especially yoga, reading, taking walks. I am interested in photography.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	No	Yes	I am allergic to nuts and parsley, and lactose intolerant.	I generally don't have breakfast.	Yes	I would prefer to live with a family with no pets.		Second	First	The most important thing for me is having my own space. I usually study in my room, go to bed early and wake up early. I would prefer having a decent internet connection where I end up living.
Pass	Emilie	Yes	Yes	I am in the process of arranging my own homestay with a family friend in Paris.  Her name is Sylvie Koechlin and her address is 277, rue du faubourg St Antoine 75011 Paris.	My mother is French and most of her family still lives in France.  We go visit them in the South of France for two weeks to a month most summers. Last summer, I participated in a month long French immersion program with a home-stay component in Annecy France.	When i was fourteen, we hosted a French girl for the summer. Last summer, I lived with a host family in Annecy France.  These were both positive experiences, and I learned a lot about French culture.  I think that for a semester I would want a living situation that allowed me to maximize my independence.	I have a younger sister who is a junior in high school.  My Dad is a lawyer, and my Mom designs jewelry.	No	No	No	Even though I haven't had these experiences in the past, a big part of why I want to study abroad is to learn how to live independently in an urban environment.	I want to study abroad in France to become fluent in my maternal language, to become a more independent person, and to experience a lifestyle and culture that aren't available in Middletown. I	I'm a college of letters student, and I'm also really interested in theater and English.	Theater is my main extracurricular, but I've also been involved in poetry journals and newspapers.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes				No.	My principal concern with housing is that I get to live with people who are kind and welcoming. It's also important to me that I live in a central location and that I have independence.	Second	First	I'm pretty good at adapting and being a good guest.  I love animals. I'm not the neatest person. I love food and want to learn more about cooking.  I love literature and theater, and it's always been a dream of mine to live in Paris!
Pravitz-Rosen	Theodore	No	Yes		I have traveled in London, Paris, Scotland, England, and Amsterdam.  Each stay has been 2-3 weeks.	No	I live with my mother and father.  My mother  is 60 and a dancer and licensed independent social worker.  My father is 87 and is retired and a playwright. We are reformed Jews.	Yes	Yes	Yes	I have lived in communal housing for a semester and would like to live in with a family that might do some sharing of food and cooking duties.	I would like to study sociology in a context outside of the United States and to strengthen my french language communication skills.	Sociology and french	I enjoy meditating, cooking, making and watching films, playing table tennis, quidditch, basketball, and tennis, visiting museums, making music, and writing songs and poetry.	No	No	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes	No	No	None	I try to observe Shabbat, which is the Jewish sabbath on friday night, but that doesn't include any unusual dietary restrictions.	Yes	Mild allergies to cats.	That I live in an easy-going house that will not result in tension, and that my hosts are patient and tolerant with my slow-ish comprehension of French.	First	Second	I would love to live in a house with someone who is very knowledgeable about cooking, as I love expanding my knowledge about how to cook! Susan in the study abroad office mentioned that there might be a host who is a chef, this would be incredible for me! -  - I am more than happy to live in a house with children and/or animals.  Generally I need to be solitary when I am studying, so a relatively quiet space would be good.  I usually sleep pretty easily, going to bed around 1-2 and getting up around 9:30-10.  If at all possible, it would be great to be placed with a Jewish family to be able to experience French-jewish culture a bit and be able to practice shabbat with them, but this doesn't matter that much.
Rosenthal	Elana	Yes	Yes		I have only traveled to a foreign country once. This summer I visited Israel for 10 days through the Birthright Program.	I have never had a home stay experience or hosted an international student.	My mother is a nurse practitioner. My older sister is 22 and is currently working on cancer research in Boston. My brother, age 16, is still in high school.	No	Yes	No	Living in traditional dormitory style living has helped me realize that I would definitely prefer to live in a house or apartment setting.	I hope to improve my French language skills, truly experience the French culture, and develop new perspectives on my own.	I love literature and additionally enjoy studying history, writing, and astronomy.	I play classical violin and have many years of orchestra experience. I enjoy reading in my leisure time. I have also begun fencing at Wesleyan.	No	No	Yes	No	No	No	Yes	No	No	I am allergic to eggs. Though restrictive, my allergy is not extremely severe. I can eat moderately of dishes that have very few eggs thoroughly cooked or baked into them (such as cakes and breads), however I cannot consume plain eggs or dishes such as frittatas and omelets. - I am also somewhat lactose intolerant. This allergy is less limiting with the aid of lactose intolerance pills and I may eat sparingly of dishes containing some dairy. However, I cannot drink straight milk or consume heavily dairy dishes such as pizza, ice cream, or cream-based soups.	I keep kosher. However, with my vegetarianism and food allergies, this custom does not add any more limitations to my diet.	Yes	I am unfortunately allergic to cats. However, I could live with one or two with the aid of allergy medication.	I would very much like to have a sense of family or at least friendly relationship with my host or hosts. I would also enjoy living in a walkable neighborhood or at least an area with easy access to public transportation.	First	Second	I am fine with living with children and/or animals. I would enjoy living with host(s) who share one or more of my interests. I believe I am relatively neat and considerate and would hope to live with equally reasonable people. I also very much hope that my dietary restrictions do not have an enormous effect on my housing. Though they are problematic, I have learned to work around my food allergies and hope I would not prove to be too much of a trouble to my host(s).
Salah	Yasmine	No	Yes		Yes. I am originally from Jordan. I have lived there my whole life but have been living in the United States for the past three years and attending college here. I've traveled to multiple cities in Europe. I have been to London for three weeks. I stayed in an apartment with my sister and we traveled to Paris from there for a few days by train. Last summer I visited Rome for a few days and traveled to Florence and Naples by train.	No.	My family consists of five members; my parents, my sister and my brother. My family is very close and our relationship are extremely well. Both my parents work in Jordan, my father is 51 years old and my mother is 46 years old. My sister, who is 23, graduated college and lives in New York City. My brother is in high school in Jordan and is currently 17 years old.	Yes	Yes	Yes	This past summer, I lived in an apartment in New York City while I was taking a summer course at New York University. I lived with four other roommates. I loved being situated in the center of the city and hope to be able to live in the center of Paris where everyone is nearby and everything is easily accessible. I would love to be surrounded by college students of the same age as I am looking forward to meeting many new people. - I did realize from this living experience that I do like to have my own personal space. I would like to be able to have the time to spend on my own without any interference especially when it comes to studying, sleeping and relaxing. I would like to have the choice to be among people or by myself and therefore a separate room or private area would be most suitable.	My main goal is to become fluent in the French language. Studying abroad for an entire semester will strengthen my ability to speak the language with the certain francophone dialect. It will also help strengthen my ability to speak in the colloquial style of the native French speakers through constant interaction. Another reason for studying in Paris is for the cultural experience. The cultural experience offers exposure to a European society; exposure to another diverse group of people; exposure to one of the most exotic, foreign cities in the world; and exposure to beautiful historical sites and monuments.	I am currently double majoring in Economics and French. I am hoping to Pursue French next semester and possibly take one Economics course at the university.	I am interning at City Hall this semester; specifically Poughkeepsie's Department of Finance in order to enhance my knowledge and understanding of Economics and Finance. - During my leisure time, I enjoy horseback riding, yoga, swimming and most water sports in general and watching plays, concerts and shows.	Occasional smoker	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	None	None	Yes	No.	My main concern of living with a host family is the excessive rules that may be set. As a 20 year old college student who has been living on her own for three years - in a foreign country - I believe that I can make most of my decisions. I intend to fully respect the people I am living with and the house I am living in but I believe I should have the leniency a college student should have in terms of curfew, traveling ... -  - Another concern is living somewhere on the outskirts of Paris. I would much rather living within close parameters of where I'll be studying. I would also want to be in an area in the center of the city where I'll feel safe walking around in and using public transportation during all hours.	First	Second	I changed my mind and decided I would like to live with a host family, but the following are extremely important to me and were the main reason I had wanted an apartment with only one student in the first place.  - Cleanliness and tidiness are extremely important to me. I would sometimes say that I am OCD; if things are not as clean as I want them to be I tend to feel extremely uncomfortable. A separate bathroom would be very satisfying since it will be my own space and I will be responsible to clean it.  - When it comes to studying, I study best on my own and in complete silence. Therefore quiet time in the house would be best fitting. - I like children so that shouldn't be a problem.  - I'm a little scared of big dogs, however if they are calm and well trained that is not a problem either.  - I am a very friendly and respectful person and I will definitely respect any house that I am placed in as well as the people living in it. However as stated above, I do not want to be completely integrated with the family and that is why I would prefer some private space in the house for myself. As well as leniency, I do enjoy my own quiet time during the day, especially after a long day of classes.
Selter	Emily		Yes		I spent a summer in France in high school, I spent 3 weeks in Paris and 3 weeks in Aix en Provence. I also spent a summer in Spain when I was in high school. I also went on a teen tour during the summer through Europe for 5 weeks. And I have travelled on vacation to other European countries such as Germany, England, Austria, Switzerland, Italy and Hungary for 5-10 days each.	No	My dad is 54 and he is retired. My mom is 47 and she is an editor at a fashion magazine. I have a brother who is 17 and in high school	Yes	Yes	Yes	This year, I am living in a house with my friends. I love living with people and being able to cook together and spend time together, but living with other people has also made me appreciate my privacy. In Paris, I would love to have a room that is big enough that I will be comfortable spending time in. Also, living with other people has also made me realize I really like having my own bathroom, and I would like to have my own bathroom in Paris.	Paris is one of my favorite cities, and I am looking forward to spend an extended period of time living there so that I get get to know the city even better. I love going to the museums and exploring the different neighborhoods. I am looking forward to taking art history classes in one of the art centers of the world. Also, I really want to improve my French and  am excited to be able to use it on a daily basis.	I am an art history major, and I am especially interested in 20th century French art. I also love French history and literature.	I interned at Chanel in New York City for the past two summers, and I am very interested in fashion. I also love going to museums and reading books.	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	I am lactose intolerant but I take lactaid pills so it is not a problem	None	No	No	I want to be centrally located, because I know central Paris very well and I would feel most comfortable in a neighborhood that I am familiar with. I will have an internship when I am in Paris that is going to be right across the Seine from St. Germain, and I would love to live in St. Germain so that I can walk home from my internship in a neighborhood that I know is safe. I would feel very uncomfortable if I had to take the metro at night. Also, I would like to live in St. Germain so that I will be between my internship and my classes, so that I don't spend all of my time commuting.	First	Second	I would prefer not to live with a family with small children or a large dog. I am a neat person and I would like to live in a clean and organized house. I would also like to live in a house that is quiet.
Toy	Kelly	Yes	Yes		I participated in a People to People Student Ambassador Program that traveled throughout Europe for three weeks during the summer before my senior year of college. We spent a week in Italy (Rome, Assisi, Perugia, Florence), a week and a half in France (Paris, Versailles, Cannes, Montpellier, Nice), and two days in London. I’ve also spent four days vacationing in Montreal, Bermuda, and the Bahamas.	While on the People to People Student Ambassador Program, I spent four days in a homestay in Montpellier. The family consisted of a couple in their late 20s, the woman’s parents, her teenage sister, and their dog. Though we all had dinners together, the family did not interact very much with the two other American girls I was with or me otherwise. For my housing next semester I would love to be placed in a home with many residents again with whom I can share meals, but I would also like to be part of a family that wants to spend time with me. This time around I’m looking to be welcomed more as a member of the family than simply as a houseguest who shares the bathroom. I’ve never hosted an international student.	I live in a two-bedroom apartment on the fifth floor with my mother (55 years old), my father (55 years old), and my younger brother (18 years old). I am very used to (and have come to enjoy) sharing my living space with others. My mom works for a specialty advertising company, and my dad does credit marketing for Macy’s. I do not have any pets.	Yes	Yes	Yes	From this style of living arrangement I’ve learned that while I value having my independence and my own space, I very much enjoy living with roommates and having people around.	My principal reasons for going to Paris are to perfect my command of the French language and to experience French and European culture in a way that would never be possible as a tourist. There is no more efficient way to become fluent in a language than to be surrounded by it and forced to speak it, and there is no better way learn about another culture than to fully immerse yourself in it.
