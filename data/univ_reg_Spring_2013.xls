Aybar	Melissa	French		Psychology		3rd	5th	1st	2nd	4th	I need to be back by May 18th and paris 7 seems like it fits most with that schedule. I am still a little confused with course dates vs. exam dates as it is anyway. After Paris 7, the rest of the choices were arbitrary.	Yes, I would love to be back for graduation for my family. I also have a research project to begin the last week of May. Coming back after that could put a dent in those plans - I am not going to be upset if I cannot make it back early enough but it would just be convenient. Either way its a win-win, I'd be in paris!

Bonneau	Alyssa	Government		French Studies		2nd	3rd	1st	4th	5th	Paris 7 and 3 are both very similar to the university system that I am currently experiencing at Wesleyan. I really like the variety of classes available, since I am not sure what subjects I want to pursue. I have heard that Paris 7 frequently has smaller classes and more in-depth courses, which are both things that I really like about Wesleyan.	Although I am interested in the courses available at Paris 7, it is also important that it ends earlier. I have started to look at internships, and many of the ones that I would like to apply for begin sometime in May. I would not want to cut my studies short, or risk not being able to pursue the opportunities I want.

Centofanti	Kate	French	Education	Psychology		2nd	3rd	1st		4th	In looking at courses listed at Paris 7, I found that it had the widest variety of courses, including psychology courses that I felt looked interesting and that I would be able to count towards my Psychology major upon returning. Furthermore, I enjoy that there are many different kinds of courses, as I want to experience as many different types of courses in Paris as possible, and Paris 7 would not limit me very much at all in that way. I chose Paris 3 as my second choice because I enjoy French film, and have already taken 2 French film courses at Wesleyan, so for me it would be interesting to see how the courses here compared to the courses in Paris.	I have been offered an internship at my former high school that they would like me to begin as soon as possible this spring, and so if I were able to attend Paris 7 and get home at the beginning of May as opposed to at the end, I would have an extra month of my internship, which is preferable.

Chan	Alda	French		LJST (Law, Jurisprudence, and Social Thought)		2nd	3rd	1st	4th	5th	Paris 7 and Paris 3 are respectively my 1st and 2nd choices because they offer courses that will help me complete my double major at Amherst College.

Dellplain	Melanie	Psychology		French Studies		2nd	3rd	1st	4th	5th	I'd like to attend Paris 7 because it offers courses in Psychology, which I'm majoring in. I marked Paris 3 as my second choice because I'd also be interested in studying literature and film, if I was unable to study Psychology.	My university choice is not motivated by the calendar.

Demelier	Adrien	Economics	French			2nd	3rd	1st	4th	5th	I chose Paris 7 as my 1st choice school because I am an Economics major and I can take advantage of opportunities to study what I love to study in a different language. I hope that learning economics in a different country with French students will give me a different prospective on the subject. Therefore, think it is best that I take economics classes while I am in France because it is the subject with which I have the most familiarity, this means that I can compare the smaller nuances between French and English higher education. By taking courses in Economics I can also build towards my major back at Vassar. It is important to me that I will be progressing towards being a better economist while improving my language skills and I can insure this by studying at Paris 7. I chose Paris 4 as my second choice because although it may not help towards my major I could take a literature class and hopefully greatly improve my written French.	My choice is not motivated by the calendar.	Paris 7		2010	United States	Woodbridge	Connecticut	Junior	Economics	2011	Economics	Economics	Non					
Dorsey	Emily	French Studies		Sociology		2nd		1st			Paris 7 is my first choice university in Paris, because it offers many french literature courses that interest me. Additionally, its formations and courses most closely resemble the comprehensive nature of American universities, allowing me to pursue courses in sociology in addition to literature courses.	Also, the calendar for Paris 7 will allow me to return to the U.S. in time to be available to participate in a summer internship that will provide me with experiences that will be very valuable to me in the future.

Dowling	Emily	English	French (planned)			2nd	3rd	1st	4th	5th	I selected Paris 7 as my first choice because I would like to study the social sciences, preferably history or sociology, while I am in Paris. Although I am an English major at Vassar, I will be unable to receive any credit towards my major while I am abroad, and therefore I would like to use my time in Paris to explore other subjects within the French university system. While at Vassar, history and sociology have been two areas outside of my major in which I am passionate, but I have not been able to study them as much as I would like due to course requirements in my major, and I would thus love to delve deeper into these subjects in the French language and from a French perspective. I put Paris 3 as my second choice because I would be very happy to study literature at Paris 3 if I am unable to study at Paris 7: this would allow me to further explore French literature while improving my writing abilities in French and honing my knowledge of literary analysis.	My choice is not motivated by the calendar.	Paris 7	High school diploma	2010	United States	Atlanta	Georgia	Junior	English	2010	English	histoire, sociologie 	Non					
Elbaum	Emma	Anthropology					2nd	1st	3rd	4th	My first choice is Paris 7 because it offers the broadest range of humanities, which are the types of courses I plan on taking.  Paris 4 also has several humanities programs, which is why it appeals to me, but is more specialized than Paris 7.

Esocoff	Sarah	College of Letters	Writing Certificate			1st	3rd	2nd			I want to study in either Paris 3 or Paris 7 because they offer more classes in the fields I am interested in.  Particularly, they offer several literature classes that intersect with other subjects, such as art history and film.  As a College of Letters major, I am drawn to interdisciplinary study, and Paris 3 especially has many classes that fall under that category.  Paris 3 also has the most options for arts based classes, which is important because I plan to do a painting thesis.

Kaufman	Michael	Cognitive Science	French			1st	4th	2nd	3rd	5th	I made Paris 3 my primary choice because I am interested in studying literature.  Most of my courses so far at Vassar have been social sciences but I have a passion for reading and writing creatively.  This will allow me to fullfil that desire but still gain credits towards my correlate.  I made Paris 7 my second choice because it is the school with courses most closely related to my major.  I can take psychology and sociology classes at Paris 7 if I can't get into Paris 3.  These courses would sort of fit into cognitive science and would allow me to study my major abroad.  However, I checked with my advisor and none of them would count towards Cognitive Science credit so I feel like it's time to explore something new and towards my correlate.

Kosman	Hannah	French	English			1st	3rd	2nd	4th	5th	My main academic interests are in languages and literature, so I the wide variety of arts and humanities courses offered by Paris 3 appeals to me. I would have the possibility of taking course in Spanish or Theater in addition to literature courses. Paris 7 would also offer me many opportunities in my main areas of interest, but without such a wide variety, and with more of a focus on the social sciences.	The calendar has not particularly affected my choice.

Kudman	Zachary	Political Science	Economics		Philosophy	3rd	1st	2nd	4th		My first choice is Paris 4 because it offers the courses which conform most closely to those subjects which I am studying/majoring in at Vassar. Among the choices available, Paris 4 is the only university which offers courses related to politics, specifically offering courses in Political Philosophy, which nicely combines my interests in Political Science (my major) and Philosophy. Paris 4 additionally offers subjects which I am peripherally interested in and would like to further explore, such as music and comparative literature. My second choice would be Paris 7 because, while it does not offer courses in politics, it offers courses in economics and other social sciences such as history and sociology. Overall, Paris 4 easily offers the courses which align most closely with my academic interests and studies while Paris 7 comes in at second.	My choice of university is solely affected by the courses offered.

Nguyen	John	Philosophy		French and Francophone Studies		4th	1st	2nd	3rd	5th	I am majoring in philosophy, and wish to study at the Sorbonne in order to broaden my exposure to different ways of studying and doing philosophy. The courses at Paris 4 would best serve my needs in that regard, which is why it is my first choice. It is very important to me that I be able to study philosophy while abroad, because I plan to transfer credits to count towards my philosophy degree at Vassar, and if I cannot, the completion of my major will become much more difficult. I chose Paris 7 as my second choice because, if I am unable to study philosophy, I would at least like to pursue studies in history or math.	My choice is not motivated by the academic calendars of the universities, only by which will provide me with the opportunity to study within my field.

Orchant	Danielle	Africana Studies	Education			2nd		1st	3rd		I am looking to have a wide range of course possibilities during my time in France, largely because I am in good shape for my major requirements at Bowdoin. Specifically,  I would like to be able to take courses in departments that Bowdoin has few to no offerings in. After reviewing both the program's information on the different universities and the university's websites themselves, it seems that Paris 7 has the greatest variety of offerings, including a number of fields that interest me that Bowdoin does not offer. These include but are not limited to geography, applied math in the social sciences, and linguistics (the science of language). Paris 7 offers those options while also offering courses in departments in which I've already had positive experiences, such as history and "lettres" (more general humanities, such as literature). I chose Paris 3 as my second choice because it has many of these options in departments I've already been positively exposed to, and also has departments that have a similar interdisciplinary structure to the Africana Studies program at Bowdoin.	The vast majority of my reasoning behind my choice of university is based on the wide variety of courses at Paris 7. However, Paris 7's calendar also works to my advantage in being able to start a summer job earlier, as well as to attend a family event at the end of May. Because I am trying to save up money for graduate school, starting a summer job a few weeks earlier would be helpful to me.

Parks	Katherine	College of Letters		Music		2nd	1st	3rd	4th	5th	As a music major, my advisor has required me to take two music history classes while abroad to keep up with the requirements for the major. Paris 4 is the only university which has a music program, so it is important for me to take my classes there. Paris 4 can offer me the strong Western perspective on music that Wesleyan cannot. If I do not complete these requirements while abroad, I may not be able to complete the Music major.     I do understand, however, that space is limited at Paris 4. Should I need to attend another university, I would prefer Paris 3 because it offers courses most similar to my COL interests. It would provide an opportunity to deeply explore some of the topics we discuss in class.	My choice is not motivated by the calendar.

Rosenthal	Elana	College of Letters				1st	2nd	3rd			Paris 3 is my first choice. Unlike the other Parisian universities, Paris 3 offers a course of study in Hebrew and Judaic Studies. I have taken Hebrew in the past and hope to take up study of the language again while in France. Paris 3 also has some wonderful courses in literature, my primary interest, and cinema. I took an introductory course to French cinema here at Wesleyan and intend to study the subject more in depth in Paris.    Paris 4 is my second choice. It also offers some courses in Hebrew which Paris 7 does not have at all. Like Paris 3, I am drawn to the literature courses. However, Paris 4 has a concentration in musicology that the other universities do not. (Paris 7 offers some music courses, but they are part of a larger plan of study of the arts and are quite broad and introductory). I have played violin since I was 4 and am very interested in studying classical music formally.

Salah	Yasmine	Economics		French		2nd	3rd	1st			I chose Paris for my 1st option since there are Economics courses and I would like to take at least one there. I can take French courses at all three universities but Paris 7 is the only university where I can take both French and Economics. If Paris 7 is not an option, I would enjoy going to Paris 3 and take all French courses, therefore it is my second option.	My choice of university is not motivated by the calendar since I would love to stay in France for as long as possible and Paris 7 has the shortest semester length.

Selter	Emily	Art History		French		2nd	1st	3rd	4th	5th	I am an Art History major, so I would like to be able to take classes at Paris 4. One of the main reasons I am coming to Paris is to study Art History and go to museums, and Paris 4 is the only university that offers Art History classes. Also, taking Art History classes is the only way I could get credit towards my Art History major. If I weren't able to take classes at Paris 4, my second choice would be Paris 3 so I could take literature classes and European studies classes.

Toy	Kelly	French Studies		History		2nd	3rd	1st	4th	5th	At Wesleyan, I am double-majoring in French Studies and history, with a concentration in American history. In addition to learning about the United States, I very much enjoy studying the countries of Europe throughout the 20th century. I will only be able to receive credit towards both of my majors while I’m abroad if I take history classes in Paris. After researching all of the French universities and browsing through their course catalogs, I have found that Paris 7 offers the academic program that best suits my interests, needs, and desires. Paris 7 has the largest variety and quantity of history courses for students to choose from. I would love the opportunity to take such classes as “Histoire de l’Europe (1945-1992),” “La campagne pour le vote des femmes,” or “Libéralisme et parti libéral en Angleterre.” After Paris 7, I believe that Paris 3 would be the next best option for me. Though Paris 3 offers fewer history courses, I would still have the ability to take classes in the European Studies department like “L’Europe et ses nations 1914-1945” or “Histoire de la construction européenne.”		Paris 7	Fox Lane High School Diploma	2010	United States	Bedford	New York	Junior	History	2010	History	History	Non
