Hollithron	Henry	Yes	Yes		I've been to Colombia a few times for about a month at a time. This was not for educational purposes, but rather to make the acquaintance of the majority of my relatives.	No.	My father, who is 51, is a senior systems analyst at a bank, though I don't live with him. My mother and two of my sisters are blind. My mother, also 51, is a Spanish-English telephonic interpreter. My eldest sister Juliet (27) is also a telephonic interpreter, though she majored in music in college and has hopes of doing more singing. My sister Michelle (24) doesn't have a job because of what we suspect is Aspergers syndrome, though we are hoping to rectify this. Nicole (21) is sighted and works as an assistant to a lawyer.	Yes	Yes	No	I should like to live in a situation in which I don't have room mates, as the one experience of that kind I had left a most unfavorable impression on my mind. Also, Kaysley, my Seeing Eye (r) dog, wouldn't do well in a room mate situation, since trying to keep track of whether or not my room mate was following the guidelines of petting would be a hastle. As to cooking, I am learning to cook with my mother.	I am coming to Paris to improve my ability with the French language, observe a French view of history, learn how computer science is done there by studying such aspects as the terminology, and experience a culture which is quite different from American culture and perhaps different from that of Colombia.	history, computer science, and languages, especially Russian and French	I most love reading books, especially of a historical nature, though I also like fiction--Sherlock Holmes being my favorite literary character and programming as a hobby. I also enjoy swimming, biking, running, and listening to music, especially classic rock of the 1960s and 1970s, musicals, and classical music. I must confess, however, that I absolutely detest modern music--anything beyond 1990, nor do I enjoy attending dances. Finally, I am quite the chatterbox, and if a person is amenable, I can spend hours on end conversing with him.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes			No	I am allergic to cats. I also have seasonal allergies, but those can't be prevented. Also, I have been known to break out in hives after making physical contact with certain plants, but this also isn't something controllable.	The most urgent matter is to find a situation that will accommodate both myself and Kaysley. If this means living a bit farther away from the nearest bus or train station, that is all right, since it would provide us with a good bit of walking.			I don't mind living with children, so long as it is made clear that feeding Kaysley is expressly not allowed. This is not only a disciplinary matter, it is also a health issue, since, unlike humans, dogs do not adjust well to drastic changes in what they eat, and she could become extremely sick if she were fed human food, which I never give her. I also can tolerate a certain amount of noise, but I'd rather not have to deal with people listening to extremely loud music in the next room, for instance. Also, a certain amount of neatness would make me feel more comfortable.
