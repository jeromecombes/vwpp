Brown	Angela	Yes	Yes		I have only travelled to Italy for a 10 day vacation, to Canada (Montreal and Quebec City), and within the United States.  - I have never lived in another country and have never traveled to France.	I have never had a home stay experience or hosted an international student, but I have been a "student fellow" at Vassar for the past two semesters.  This job entails helping first year students to adjust to life at Vassar.  Three of the freshmen that I advise are international students and it has been very interesting and informative to hear about their own experiences adjusting to a new country.  One of these students is actually from Paris and it has been great talking to him about his first impressions of communicating with American students and faculty and how that compares to what he is accustomed to in Paris. My relationship with this student has blossomed mostly on a one-on-one level rather than in a larger group context with other first year students so I am excited to foster a relationship with my host mother or family in a similar way.	I come from a middle class family in Yonkers, NY, so I am comfortable in busy city settings (I travel into the city often) as well as more suburban set-ups.  My mother is Puerto Rican and Italian and she comes from a relatively small family while my father is Irish and Lithuanian and comes from a large family.  Because of my exposure to these very different dynamics, I find it quite easy and natural to find my niche in various family set ups, though I find I am most comfortable getting to know people on an individual basis since I enjoy conversation. I have only one sibling, a younger brother, who just started middle school.   My family often eats dinner together in a very laid-back way.  We usually discuss whatever is going on in our lives; my parents both work in customer service/sales so they have passed on a lot of people skills to me and my brother.	No			Although I have not lived independently before, I consider myself very independent and do much of the cooking, etc. at home.	Through my studies of the French language, exposure to Parisian culture, and ongoing interests in art and, essentially, the complex way that humanity lives and changes, I feel that Paris will be a great place to allow myself to think differently and come to understand various aspects of modern life in a more nuanced and contextual way.  I've never before been given the opportunity to make my own adventure in a new place in this way, so I hope to learn a lot about my self in relation to the world around me in a setting that isn't native, and therefore somewhat disenchanted, to me.  I've always had a propensity to soak up inspiration in any place, so Paris will give me the opportunity to do that on a grander scale and remember it forever.	I'm primarily interested in art history, religion, and linguistics.  However, since I plan to count all of my credits earned abroad as French credits to go towards a French correlate (minor) at Vassar, I am very open to trying classes in different areas such as theater, literature, music, anthropology, etc.	I love museums, going for aimless strolls, sitting casually over coffee with friends, and seeing performances like jazz shows, etc. I love to read, draw, paint, and sit in the sun.  I run and do yoga somewhat often.  Really my favorite days are those when I jump into new, maybe unfamiliar, settings and soak it all in, making the best of it and exploring as much as possible.	Occasional smoker	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	n/a	n/a	No	non	A priority for me would be establishing a good and comfortable relationship with my host as soon as possible.  I know that this will be an ongoing process, but I hope for a host that is interested in getting to know me on a personal level as I highly value coming home to a stable and welcoming home.			I wake up sort of early - not with the sun, but rarely later than 9am.  I'm a "morning person" in that I like having extra time to eat breakfast, read the newspaper, etc. before going wherever I have to go. I like staying up late and/or going out on the weekends. I’m neat, but not pristine. I love dogs and I’ve been told I do well with children.  I study best in the daylight and I like to change locations - outside when it's nice out, curled up on a couch or in a café or library when it's cold. I'm not very noisy, but I listen to music often and enjoy when others introduce me to their favorite music.
Clemens	Julia	Yes	Yes		I've traveled to France twice before, once with my family and once for an exchange trip. On the exchange trip I stayed in Lyon with a family for two weeks. I have traveled many other times to different countries, most recently to Haiti for two weeks.	I had a home stay with a family in Lyon, and I had two french students stay with me in Baltimore on two separate occasions. I really liked my host family, I would like to live with a family who has children or someone my age.	My mother is a pediatric geneticist and my father is a pediatric dentist. I have an 18 year old brother and I have a 15 year old brother and we have a dog.	No	No	No	I've only lived in a dorm alone.	I want to improve my French and also to see what life in France is like, I've always wanted to study in Paris and be able to live with real French people.	I am a French major and also I am premed.	I teach swimming and also lifeguard, and I am in a dance group. I also am in a group that teaches science to elementary school students in an after school program.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	I'm allergic to pepperoni.		No	I have asthma so I can't live with people who smoke and I am allergic to cats.	I want to live with a family who doesn't live too far from the schools and who has some children. If I have to choose one or the other, I would rather be in the city of Paris than have a family with children.			I would like a family who has children that I can communicate with. I like to study in my room, I tend to go to sleep relatively early and wake up kind of early as well. Preferably they would be close to the universities as well as close to other people in the program if possible.
Dade	Anne	Yes	Yes		In high school, I did a two week home stay with a family in Joigny, France.  I was born in the United Kingdom and moved to America when I was nine. Living in England allowed my family to do a lot of traveling around Europe, in Italy, Germany, Czech Republic, Austria, and Switzerland.	The home stay that I did in Joigny was incredible. The family welcomed me in and did everything they could to make me comfortable. It was a very sheltered way to be introduced to French culture. I did all of the activities that the program and my family arranged, and was never allowed to explore the village alone. On the weekends, I went with the family to run errands or visit their other family members. Juliette, a student my age, had come to stay with my family earlier in the year for two weeks as well. The two of us got along really well, and did our best to understand and fully experience each other's lives. That being said, I now have a full appreciation for the work and energy that it takes to be constantly planning for and hosting a guest. I fully appreciate the family experience, but I am ready for a bit more independence, especially because this experience will be for such an extended period of time. I am excited about a housing experience in Paris that will allow myself to develop more self-reliance and independence. I would enjoy living with a family, because I love getting to know other kids of any age, so that is not an eliminating factor for me, but I would prioritize a housing situation that would allow me to live more independently than my experience in Joigny.	My father is a professor at Dartmouth College, and my mother works from home. My brother is 23 and studies at Stanford University. We live on a large farm in Vermont, with lots of animals and green space. My parents have fostered in my brother and I a connection to the natural world, our many pet animals, and a healthy life style. They also value travel and have given my brother and I the opportunity to see a lot of awesome places around the world.	No	No	No		I want to come to Paris in order to challenge myself to live and adapt to another culture. I have never lived in a city before, so I am excited about learning how to navigate an urban landscape. I adore the French language and am excited about mastering it.  In addition, I want to take full advantage of the cultural and historical richness of the city by doing as much exploring as possible and learning from the people with whom I interact.	English and French studies; my academic passions are for critical reading and writing. My favorite classes at Wesleyan have been in the English department, analyzing and discussing literature as well as creative writing classes. I also am very interested in psychology and philosophy of the mind, which plays into the analysis of human behavior and characterization in literature.	I am on the Wesleyan women's crew team and spend about 2-3 hours a day training with the team. I am incredibly passionate about this sport, and being active in general. I really enjoy outdoor activities, and will be excited to take weekend trips to some of the mountain ranges and hiking spots in France. In my free time I like to read, listen to music, go for walks, take photos, and socialize.	No	No	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes	No	No			Yes	Nope!	I would really like a housing situation where I have the freedom and independence to create my own schedule. I would also like to be close to the city of Paris, not on the outskirts. It is also very important for me to remain active and eat healthily. I would really appreciate access to a local gym, and a kitchen to cook my own meals when necessary.			I love children and animals and would be happy to live with them! That being said I still prioritize living an independent lifestyle close to the city, so that I can really explore living in a city. I am neat and will always clean up after myself, but I don't mind a little mess! I tend to go to bed before midnight and wake up around 830 or 9 am, but can always be flexible.
Frye	Liliana	Yes	Yes		I traveled to Scotland and lived with a family for 10 days in June 2012.	Yes, as previously mentioned, I lived with a Scottish family for 10 days, and also hosted a girl from the same family for 10 days. I enjoyed it and believe that being immersed in the culture even at home is extremely beneficial to the overall experience.	My family is intact (no divorce); I am the oldest of 3 children, the only girl with twin brothers (17 years old). My parents are both teachers, so my family is very academically active. We also are very physically avtice and love to hike, etc together.	No	No	No	I have very little experience cooking for myself, but this summer (before Paris), I will be in a situation where I live with 4 other roommates and will be responsible for my food, etc, so I am not very worried about that in Paris (but I am worried for the summer... and ready to learn).	I have always wanted to travel to Paris because of the art and beauty, and for the language. And for the cheese.	I am a Physics major, but intend to pursue more of the humanities classes while I am in Paris, and take the trip as not only as an opportunity to explore spatially, but an opportunity to explore the other areas of study that I have not had time to invest in.	I am a varsity swimmer, and like to be active as much as possible (walking, running, biking, etc). I enjoy drawing, volunteering, and eating.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	I am allergic to tilapia, but as far as I know that is my only fish problem (I love shellfish, and other types of fish such as salmon).		No	no.	I would prefer if my housing were in an accessible area, where I can walk most places, and if I can't walk, then a bus, etc is very close and accessible. I want to be in the center of things, close to culture (main streets, "town centers," places where people assemble).			I am very friendly and easygoing to live with. I am neat, I like kids, I like pets, and I sleep regular hours. I would like it if my host family would be okay with me bringing friends over occasionally, and if they are okay with me staying out late from time to time.
Gittins	Sarah	Yes	Yes		I traveled to Paris for a week with my family and stayed in a hotel.	No.	I live with my mother, father, younger sister and a dog. My father is in software sales and currently works in an office off of the house (57yo). My mother is an accountant (50yo). My younger sister is 15 years old and does theater and sports. My dog is very hyper.	No	No	Yes	I have stayed for brief periods in independent situations, and I cooked for myself. I enjoy cooking. I have lived with roomates before.	To learn the language, to have a new experience, and to globalize myself.	Film, physics and drama, although I may like to take some classes outside of these subjects. Possibly some psychology and art classes.	Theater, film, painting, dance, singing, gardening	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None	None	No	None	Safety and commute. I am worried about walking/traveling late at night. I want to feel as safe as possible coming home/walking around the area. Commute feeds into this; I would like to keep the commute short and safe.			Although I do not mind children, differing sleep schedules may be a bit of problem. I love animals, and would would be fine with a dog or cat in the house. Depending on what activities I do in France, I may be out late. I am fairly good at coming in quietly. I may do theater, filmmaking, and dance. Although I can be neat, neatness in the house is not a big deal for me. I will definitely work to keep the area neat, however. At the moment, I rarely work in my room, so I will probably be working at the school, out of the house or, if possible, in common areas of the house. I do listen to music, although I can put in headphones. I do have the habit of randomly singing out loud, but if it bothers the host family, I can reign it in. I often stay up late, say 1-3am and will wake up any time between 7-11am. The host family shouldn't be too worried about waking me up in the morning, they do not need to tiptoe around.
Hale	Isaiah	Yes	Yes		A friend and I went to Quebec, Canada for 4 days last summer. I have also been to Italy for a week-long vacation with my family.	Yes, my family hosted a foreign exchange student from Germany while I was a junior in high school for the entire school year. I think that he really enjoyed being part of a family with someone his own age (me) and others close to it (my older and younger brothers) to whom he could ask questions about the school, the city, and classes as well as play games and socialize with. I think I would like best to be in a family with some teenage/young adult students if possible.	My parents are both happily married dentists that work together running a dental practice, and have 3 sons (including myself) and a daughter, all currently between the ages of 15-22. My older brother and I are both majoring in natural sciences (I'm biochemistry) and plan on going into medicine. We are a close family that always has dinner together and like to play card games, board games, etc.	No				I think it is important for everyone to try to connect with and discover the world outside their daily life. I think the best way to do this for me is to study abroad and experience a completely different culture.	I have many interests and enjoy learning in general, which is why I chose to come to a liberal arts school. I am most interested in the sciences though, from biochemistry to psychology, but I also find economics and philosophy intriguing.	I am a member of the Varsity Swimming team, as well as a Chamber Music Ensemble and the Vassar Orchestra (both in which I play the flute). Last year I also rowed on the Crew Team after swimming had ended. As for leisure, I enjoy friends, movies, games, parties, and family.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes				No	That the housing will be a small and unkept place with only a single person to talk with.			I would love a family with teenagers or young adults. I like cats and dogs or other animals and don't mind noise that isn't excessive. I am neat myself, but I don't mind if others are not unless it is the common area (bathroom, kitchen). I often study, but it really depends on the classes. I sleep only at night, from about 11pm to 8am.
Iselin	Michael	Yes	Yes		I went to Paris for a week 4 summers ago.  3 summers ago I did a language immersion program where I travelled all throughout France.  I was in Paris, Provence, Loire Valley, the Alps and I even did a home stay on the border to Germany.	As I mentioned above, I did a home stay with the immersion program I did.  They were a French family in this tiny village in France near Germany.  I had a very tough time because I had to share a bunk bed with my host sister and she always spoke in English.  They were nice people but the house was not very clean either.  I felt like they would talk about me in French.  I am eager to try a home stay again hoping that it will go better the second time around.   I hope to have more of my own personal space this time around and a more friendly family.	My dad works very long hours as a lawyer but my mom does not work.  She is around most of the time and runs the house.  They are both in their mid 50's.   My mom also does a lot of volunteer work.  I have 2 brothers.  One is 25 and lives in Washington D.C. and he works in real estate.  My other brother is 22 and he is a senior at Wesleyan.	No	No	No	I have never lived in an independent living situation.	I am going to Paris to study and improve my French.  I want to be in Paris specifically so I can meet a lot of french people and get immersed in the culture and history.  I really want to take advantage of all the art and theater Paris has to offer.	Aside from French, my main focuses are Economics and American Politics.	My extra-curricular activities are playing Squash and working on film projects.  I am really interested in that.	No	No		No	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	I am allergic to certain fruits but I just avoid them.  They are cherries and peaches.	I am jewish but I do not keep kosher.  I do however avoid pork and fish.	Yes	I am not allergic to any pets.	My priority is to have a comfortable living situation.  My old host family had me share a bunk bed.  I want some space that will be mine to allow me to have privacy and to feel comfortable in my own space.  Along with this, I want a host family to engage me so I can get a real understanding of Parisian culture i.e. art, food and everyday life			I would be happy to live with children at the house.  I would be happy to teach english to kids.  It is very important to have a neat house because my old home stay was so dirty.  I can study in any conditions and am a light sleeper.  I really want an active family but where I can have my own space.
Kosman-Wiener	Naomi	Yes	Yes		I traveled to Paris with my family in sixth grade for about ten days, I traveled to Italy with my parents in eighth grade for about ten days, I traveled to Israel in eighth grade with my grade for about two weeks, and I traveled to France again in the summer after my junior year of high school. On that trip, I lived with a host family for nine days.	I did have a home stay experience in France several summers ago. I lived with a family in the south of France for nine days and it was not a great experience at all. The three daughters were completely uninterested in hanging out with me, mostly because there were a lot of personality differences (they were very into partying and staying out late, whereas I am much more reserved). It felt very lonely and was a really tough experience. I think that experience has made me wary of home stays in general, although I do feel strongly that I'd like to have one on this program. That said, I might prefer to live in a family without children.	I don't have any siblings—I live with my parents. My mom is a magazine editor and my dad reviews classical music for the San Francisco Chronicle. We're a very close family.	No	No	No		I'm really eager to improve my ability to speak French, I want to learn as much as I can about a new culture by immersing myself in it, I want to become more independent and travel across Europe, I want to study psychology from a new perspective, and I want to challenge myself in new ways.	Psychology, anthropology, and French, although I'd love to take more classes in math and history.	I am currently a staff member of my college newspaper, I write features articles and do layout, I like to read, watch films, listen to music, and ideally learn to cook.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Gluten—and I definitely plan to stay away from gluten while I'm in Paris.	Nope	Yes	Yes—sulfa drug.	My main concern is that the same thing that happened to me last time I was abroad will happen again—i.e. that I will be living with people who have no interest in engaging with me whatsoever. That's why I think I would like to live in a family without any children.			I think I've said everything above that's important to me! Although it would be nice to live in a house that's not super loud, but that's not essential.
Leahy	Erin	Yes	Yes		I have never been to France, unfortunately.  I have only been in the US and Canada, but that does include spending limited amounts of time in French Canada, namely the Quebec City.  I love this city, and have spent two weekends there in the past few years staying in my friend's condo.	Neither, unfortunately.	I have a typical nuclear family, two working parents, and a brother who is two years older than me.  My mom is 50, and is a high school history teacher.  My dad is 56 and works in marketing for biotechnology companies.  My brother is a marketing major and loves sports.  We love to laugh, play boardgames, eat my dad's amazing homemade dinners together, etc.  Family vacations usually consist of hiking, shopping, eating, etc.  We are a typical New England family in that way.  My mom loves to watch legal dramas on tv, and my brother and dad watch sports all day long, another activity that brings us together.	No	No			I truly want to become fluent in French, this is my number one goal--I've worked so hard for years to learn the language and I think this program is what I truly need to get there.  Other than the mastery of the French language, I am ecstatic to come to Paris to experience this incredible city for its culture, people, opportunities, and history.  This city has so much to offer me and to teach me that I can't even fathom.  I want to make the most out of my college years and what better way to do that than to spend a semester in Paris and learn about the city, the language, and myself?	I am a philosophy major with a French & Francophone studies minor.  Besides these two concentrations, I love English, psychology, theater, and art.	I do theater on campus, as well as Habitat for Humanity, and House Team (student government).  I love reading, writing, and studio art such as drawing, painting, and ceramics, as well as fashion.  I love TV, movies, and especially music.  I love to sing and make jokes.  I love to cook and bake, and adore great food. I also enjoy outdoor activities, such as biking, hiking, and swimming.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None	None	No	No	My priority is having a host that enjoys my presence, and has a sense of humor.  I'm very nervous that I will be scared to speak my imperfect French around my host, and hope I can feel at ease with them--I hope they will be patient with my language skills.			I am fine with children and animals in my housing situation.  I'd love it if my host had similar interests to me, but of course this isn't mandatory.  A love of food and music would definitely be somethings I'd love to share with them.  I'd prefer a host who wasn't extremely strict regarding noise level, simply because I am a loud person sometimes, but I will of course will adhere to the rules.  As for sleeping, I tend to be a bit of a night owl, and less of an early riser, so a host who wakes up and has breakfast at 6am every morning will probably not be the best fit for me.  I'd like the apartment at least somewhat clean, and I'll certainly do my part in maintaining neatness. - Overall, I just want someone who is relaxed, and will be interested in getting to know me, want to have fun during my stay, and be patient with my language skills; I very much need someone who is excited to have me, because I will be very nervous and possibly insecure at the beginning of this trip.  I also have a very goofy and outgoing personality and sense of humor, so if there are any hosts who won't mind a silly dance or bad joke every now and then, that'd be great for me!
LeFlore	Sarah-Nicole	Yes	Yes		My mother is from Ireland, so I have spent long amounts of time there. I have spent a few summers living there with my family. I have never been to France.	No.	I have three half siblings (a brother and sister from my father's first marriage who are in their thirties, and a sister from my mother's second who is seven). I live with my mother and my younger sister (for half of the week, the other half she spends with her father). I have never lived with my older siblings because they were in their late teens when I was born. My father, who was a lawyer, passed away five years ago.	No	No	No	I would like to have quite a bit of independence in France because I have not yet had the chance to live completely independently.	To gain a greater understanding of French language and culture and to become comfortable in an environment and city I am not familiar with.	Politics, French language and studies, and Italian language and studies.	I love the arts, so I like to visit museums, see live music, and go to the movies often. I spend a lot of time just hanging out and relaxing with my friends.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None.	I like to be pretty healthy for the most part, but I am not afraid to experiment with foods. I tend to eat a lot of fruit and vegetables.	Yes	I am great with dogs, but I am very allergic to cats. If I take allergy medicine, I am generally fine, so if I am placed with someone who has a cat I would like to be told before hand so I can come prepared.	I really like my privacy, and I like quiet when I study, so it might be difficult for me to live with a lot of people around. I also am concerned that I would be living far away from my classes, which would definitely be a struggle for me.			It is most important to me to be very centrally located in Paris; I would not like not to live on the "outskirts" of the city. I don't generally like young children. I appreciate privacy.
Liu	Antong	No	Yes		I've travelled in Paris for about a week. Other countries I've been to include Italy&Greece (for about 20 days in 2012), Vietnam&Cambodia (2 weeks in 2011), Singapore (1 week in 2008), Mexico (2 weeks in 2014), Australia&New Zealand (2 weeks in 2008)...	No. I'm actually quite anxious about this experience, so I hope to find a host who is easygoing.	I'm the only child, and I live with my parents and my grandmother. Both my mom and dad do business in healthcare industry. My mom is 50 and my dad is 52.	No	Yes	No	I prefer to live with a host who can cook and maybe even teach me how to cook	I love France, and I want to get to know France and its culture and art more. And I really want to practice and improve my French.	I'm interested in political economy/political theory, sociology/sociological psychology, art/art history/photography, and learning languages.	I love traveling, watching movies, running, visiting museums, reading, shopping...	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Sometimes I'm a little allergic to shrimp, although I love shrimp.		No	No.	I hope there's personal space as well as enough communication between my host and me. I'm more introvert and passive than extrovert, and it usually takes time for me to get comfortable in a new environment, so I hope the host will help me integrate better by encouraging me more.			I've kept dogs before and I love them. I love cats, though I've never had one. I prefer a host without children. I hope the host is interested in China and its culture/politics, so I can also contribute to this exchange. And I hope the host can allow me to cook Chinese food. I really love traveling, so it would be great if the host also loves traveling and we can share our experience. Although I will try my best to keep the room clean, I hope the host is not too strict about neatness. My sleeping habits are quite regular -- I usually sleep at around midnight and get up at about 9. I like to work in the daytime and tend not to procrastinate much. I guess a host who speaks not so fast would help me understand more.
Lombroso	Sonia	Yes	Yes		Yes. I lived in France for a month in a host family in Antibes France.  - I've been to Paris three times each for two weeks. I went once with my high school and twice with my family - I've been to Italy once for ten days staying with family.	Yes, in antibes, France. I was placed with a single mother with a young son. I loved the experience. She had a beautiful, clean apartment that was located close to the downtown areas of Antibes. I loved the location of being near the night life, and often went out for late dinners with my host mother or friends. I believe I would enjoy any similarities in my housing in Paris:  i.e.; close to night life/center of Paris, clean home with kitchen, young relaxed host parents.	Father: Works at Yale University. - Mother: Relaxed, teacher at Wesleyan University. - Brother: 27, lives in an apartment in New Haven. Works in law. - Brother: 22, student. Very close to him and his friends. Often go out with them to bars around our hometown	Yes	Yes	Yes	I loved living with my roommates because we were all clean, neat, and very close friends.	To become immersed in the French culture in order to better my French language skills as well as see the city of Paris and other European countries.	French and Biology. However I am also interested in government and history.	Sports, hanging out with friends, cooking, movies, art, pottery, reading, museums, beaches, exploring and science related activities.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		I generally try to eat healthily and love to help cook. I usually have salads at meals as well as lean meats.	Yes	Slight allergy to cat hair, but not very serious.	After reading the Essential Housing Information page my primary concern is living in a high numbered arrondissement because I have a hard time using the metro. I've had bad experiences in the past with using the subway system in New York as well as the metro system in Paris. It takes me a while to become adjusted with these types of transportation systems, however, I am willing to work on that and hopefully will become a master by the end of this program!			I generally go to bed at around 12 on school nights and a bit later on weekends.  - I am a neat person and would prefer to live in a neat home, although I do not mind if it is small. - Would really, really prefer to live towards the center of Paris in order to be closer to many of the sights, restaurants, and night life locations. - I get along well with other people and am easy going. - I work out once a day, generally going for runs outside or at a gym. - Prefer dogs to any other animal.  - I generally study at libraries not in my room.
Luksh	Isabella	Yes	Yes		I have spent one week in France in the summer of 2008. Additionally, in March 2013 I travelled briefly to Paris and other European cities for one week.	I have never had a home stay experience or hosted an international student.	I live with my mother, father, and sixteen year old sister. My father works from our home. We live in an large apartment building in Brooklyn, New York.	No	Yes	No	My only experience with a roommate was my freshman year at Vassar and I have never lived truly independently before, but I am excited for the opportunity to live more independently and determine my own living schedule and habits.	I am coming to Paris for the opportunity to study French literature in its original language as well as to improve my French speaking and writing, with the goal of becoming as close to fluent as possible. I am very excited to take my classes in French and to learn what it is like to be a college student in a different part of the world. I very much look forward to the cultural opportunities as well, particularly in relation to my interest in art history, and cannot wait to see firsthand many of the art works that I have studied.	I am an English major with a correlate in French. I am also very interested in art history, and am strongly considering declaring a correlate in it as well.	At Vassar, my extra-curricular activities consist of my participation in the women's rugby team, a few clubs, and the English Majors' Committee. As an athlete, I enjoy going to the gym regularly and as an English major, I spend a lot of time reading.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None.	None.	Yes	No.	I would prefer to live in a more central location of the city, if possible.			I love children and would not mind if I am placed in a family with children. I also love pets and have no allergies to any animals and have no problem living with pets. I am generally a neat person and try to stay organized but am not obsessive. At Vassar, I do all of my school work in the library and rarely in my room and I am unaware of what my situation regarding homework will be in Paris. I always go to bed late and unless I have a class or a commitment, I don't tend to wake up very early. I consider myself a very relaxed and flexible person and think I will be pleased with any living situation I am put into.
Man	Martin	No	Yes		I have travelled to many countries for short vacations, generally for less than one week. I've lived in Shanghai for 6 months before, and now I've been living in the USA at Vassar for more than a year. I've never lived in or travelled to France before.	Yes, once, in Beijing for a debate tournament. It was a generally positive experience; we stayed with a local student who was also participating in the tournament so we travelled with him, and since most of the day was taken up with the competition we didn't actually interact much with the host family. The point of the trip wasn't really cultural exchange or even in an uncomfortable language environment (as I speak Mandarin fluently), so it doesn't really have a great impact on my impending study in Paris, either postitively or negatively.	I have no siblings. My father is a sales director. My mother was a teacher and is now a housewife. We have lived in Hong Kong all my life.	No	No	No	I’ve never lived by myself in a non-dorm setting; I’ve lived with my parents my whole life. I also don’t really know how to cook for myself. It doesn’t really influence my preference, but it would probably be convenient if my housing family understood that I have never lived independently before.	I’ve never lived by myself in a non-dorm setting; I’ve lived with my parents my whole life. I also don’t really know how to cook for myself. It doesn’t really influence my preference, but it would probably be convenient if my housing family understood that I have never lived independently before.	Art, architecture, philosophy (mainly continental), critical theory, cultural theory, media studies, biology (in no particular order).	Photography, environmental activism, social activism, writing, poetry, reading, music (I play piano, trumpet, and French horn), sometimes art (painting), and travelling (in no particular order).	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None.	None.	Yes	No.	My principal priority is definitely safety and security. Which would encompass my safety from the family I am living with, but also the overall security of the place in which I will live, the surrounding environment, the neighbourhood and area, for example, the security of the streets, and the other inhabitants of the building. A secondary but also very high concern would be hygiene and cleanliness, of living environments, area around the buildings, and food and water.			I would highly prefer if there are not children—I am rather uncomfortable/awkward if I have to deal with them. I can tolerate animals if necessary (dogs are better than cats) but ideally not. As far as interests go, it would be great if I could have discussions with host members who are politically and/or academically engaged, open-minded, or at least would be open to an opinionated, far-Left leaning student. I am very clean and prefer to live in a clean environment, but I am generally not the neatest (I tend to leave things around but am never dirty). I study mainly in the evenings, sometimes late afternoon, but mostly after dinner. I can be as quiet as I need to be, up to being silent. I’m fine with any reasonable level of ambient noise—city sounds, TV, etc. I try to sleep 8-9 hours; I go to bed around 11:30-1:30 and wake up 8:30-10:30, in general. I really, really cannot live with people who smoke.
Masters	John	No	Yes		I spent two weeks during the winter of 2007 in Paris. I also spent a week in Nice during 2008. - I studied Spanish in Segovia, Spain for one month in 2010. - I toured China (Beijing, Xian, Shanghai) for two weeks in the summer of 2006	The month I spent in Segovia was with a host family. It was difficult at first because I had never studied Spanish, but, by the end, I was able to make jokes (bad ones) with my host mother. The week I spent in Nice, I stayed with a family whose son would spend a week with my family later in the year. It was my first time outside the country without my parents. It was hard to adjust even for those seven days, but I look back on the experience with fondness. Both experiences, although differing in length, fostered an appreciation for the cultures I visited and the lives of others in the respective cultures. The boy who I lived with and who then stayed with me was nice but shy. It was difficult to get him to talk much, which was the most frustrating part of my Nice experience. I suppose it made me feel even more like an outsider when I was in the house. In terms of my preferences for housing in Paris, if I were to have a host brother or sister, I would prefer him or her to be fairly social.	My parents are both very smart, very open-minded people. They both have a love of learning, so there's a lot of stress on thinking critically in my house. They are both nice people, as well. I have no siblings. My mom is 57 and a lawyer for the Department of Justice; my dad is 51 and a project manager for Bloomberg BNA.	Yes	No	Yes	I didn't mind living alone. It could get lonely at times, though. The cooking was new to me, but I'm interested in getting better at it.	I love Paris. I fell in love when I visited and have always wanted to go back. I have a fairly good understanding of French culture (I went to an international school and have been learning French since I was 3) and have wanted to immerse myself in it since my trip to Paris. I think there's a certain feeling that Paris has that syncs well with my personality. A sense of romanticism, a city filled with history, dark rainy nights contrast with flowering gardens. As far as I know, Paris is where I want to live.	My main academic interests are International Studies and French. I'm double majoring in both. They both stem from my upbringing at an international school. I have been learning French practically my whole life; International Studies comes from my appreciation for how connected the citizens of the world are. My academic foci in my IS major are Political Science and History to gain a greater understanding of France and its relation to the EU and also how globalization has and will play a role in world affairs. I'm majoring in French simply because I love the language and the culture.	I play guitar and piano, and I sing. I love music, listening to and playing it. I'm also somewhat of a cinephile. Additionally, I enjoy fashion and style. I would describe my extra-curricular interests as being defined by a fascination with aesthetics.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	I am gluten-intolerant. Also, I am allergic to cantaloupe and honeydew.		Yes	I'm allergic to cats and dogs, but have a cat nonetheless. I would prefer to not be placed with a host family with a pet so that I wouldn't have to deal with being congested.	Having the appropriate options for my dietary restriction or gluten-intolerance. Second, though, is having a pleasant host family.			I would prefer if my host family did not have small children. I get along fine with them, I just don't want to have to deal with them for three months. - I'm not generally a very tidy person (I occasionally will clean my room up), if staying with a family that is very clean, I will of course abide by their rules. - As for my sleeping habits, I usually go to sleep around 12:30 or 1 and get up around 9:30 or 10.
Maves	Kellyn		Yes		I traveled to France a few years ago for one week.  I lived in New Zealand for 11 months with my family during my freshman year of high school.	No.	My family lives in Salt Lake City, Utah.  My dad is a pilot, my mom is a pediatric radiologist, and my sister is currently a freshman at Bryn Mawr College.  My family tends to have homemade dinners as a family very frequently, we are all very active and healthy, we love to travel, we don't watch much TV, we are liberal, and we have a dog and a cat.  My dad is very neat, goes to sleep early, is interested in politics, is outgoing, and loves nature.  My mom is more laid back, is very caring, stays up later, loves to run, read, and cook.  My sister and I have different personalities but we still spend time together when we are both home.	No			N/A.	I love to travel and I think that a lot can be learned from being immersed in a foreign culture.  I am excited about seeing museums in France, tasting amazing food, and traveling around France and other European countries.  I am also a French Studies major and I hope to become fluent in French.  I think that a study abroad experience is the best way to reach this goal.	I am interested in science and health, which is why I am majoring in Neuroscience & Behavior in addition to French Studies.  While I am abroad, I hope to become fluent in French and to take art classes that I have not had time in my schedule to take here at Wesleyan.	In my spare time, I occasionally watch TV shows on my computer, read, spend time with friends, listen to music with headphones, and go for runs.  Here at Wesleyan, I tutor children in an after school care program three times a week, I am involved in a beginners dance group, and I am on the sailing team.	No	No	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	No	No	I am willing to occasionally eat chicken and turkey, but I would rather not eat it at all than be forced to eat it in large quantities or eat it very frequently.	I blow dry my hair fairly frequently and I plan to quietly Skype with my family several times a week.  I eat a lot of peanut butter or almond butter.	Yes	No.	It is very important to me that I live in a central location with a family/someone who is welcoming.  I hope to do a lot of day trips to museums, and this would be much more difficult if I was living farther away.  I also hope to take an art class of some sort at an art museum as one of my extra curricular activities, which would require me to commute to the city more often.  Given my majors, I am not exposed to art very often when I am at Wesleyan, and I really hope that I can take advantage of the rich artistic culture that Paris has while I am abroad.  Being centrally located will help me do this.			I do not mind children or animals just as long as they are not typically disruptively loud.  I tend to stay up until midnight and wake up around 8:30-9:00am during the week.  On the weekends, I stay up later and wake up later.  I am not a loud person, and I am generally neat.  I like to exercise.  I usually study in the library or in my room.  Sometimes I am shy at first.  I plan on traveling a decent amount while I am abroad, and I hope to do a lot of sight seeing.  I am sometimes shy at first.  It would be nice if my host wanted to spend time with me outside of dinner and breakfast every once in a while.
Mintz	Noah M.	Yes	Yes		I have traveled to France a few times, on vacation, the longest for 10 days in 2010, and the most recent for 4 days in 2012. I also spent 3 weeks in Guadeloupe as part of a family sabbatical in 2008, on which we visited many other countries, as well.	I spent one week staying with a family in Belgium in 2012. At first, I was uncomfortable living in their home but soon became more used to the situation. I did have some trouble communicating with my hosts (I had not been studying French long then). I am hoping that this will be easier now that I know French better, but I am hoping my hosts will be understanding if I have a hard time with language.	I have a 21-year-old sister, who is a student at a college in Chicago, and a 16-year-old brother, who is in high school. My parents are divorced, but both live in Chicago with me and I see them often when I go home. My mother is a social worker, and my father works in the tourist industry as a sailboat captain.	No				My primary reasons for studying in Paris are to learn more about the language and the cultures that speak it. Studying French in school, I have been frustrated by how slowly I learn to speak it. I am looking forward to being surrounded by opportunities to speak the language and to engage with them in their own environment. I am also very interested in film, literature, and theater, and am excited to have access to so much Francophone art.	I am a Media Studies major, focusing on writing in literature and film, as well as in drama.	Again, I like to see films and plays, as well as to read. I am also beginning to get involved with rock climbing. At school, I act and do some set design for student theater.	Occasional smoker	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None	None	No	I am mildly allergic to cats, but I could live with a cat if needed.	Mostly I am concerned with not being obtrusive in my hosts' home. I don't know what my schedule be like in Paris, but I might be up late or coming home late, and I hope I don't disturb the family, especially if they have children. Other than that, I am going to Paris to learn; I am sure that my home stay will be a huge part of that learning, and I will be up for anything.			Again, I would be nervous about waking children up. Other than that, I love animals, especially dogs. I am usually neat in my own home, and will be sure to be more so in my hosts' home. I tend to stay up late studying (around 1:00 or 2:00 am), and sometimes come home late on weekends. I am always quiet and respectful at night, even if I am up late. I am really excited to be staying with a host family, and will make every effort to be accommodating of their lifestyle!
Morgan	Tess	Yes	Yes		I've traveled to France before, but I have never been there for a period longer than two weeks.	No.	I'm very close with my family. My parents, Nicolas and Genevieve, are both of French origin but speak to me in English (my grandparents speak only in French). My dad is a lawyer and my mom is an English teacher at my former all-girls high school. They are relatively young parents since they're in their early 40s, and I spend a lot of time with them when I'm home. My sister Anya is 21 and a senior at Wesleyan this year; we are also very close. Anya went on the Vassar-Wesleyan Paris program in the fall of 2012 and had an amazing experience. She's headed to law school at UT next year. I also have a dog named Dove! She's a very small papillon puppy but I like all dogs and most animals and would be willing to live in a house with pets.	Yes	Yes	Yes	I would prefer to live in an apartment without a host family because I tend to be very independent. I grew up in a household where I was treated like an adult throughout my childhood and never had a curfew or very many rules. I live very well with other people my age because of this. I am good at sharing responsibilities such as cooking, cleaning, and washing dishes. I know it's unlikely that I'll be able to live in an apartment with other students rather than in a homestay, but if it is possible, I would prefer to live with as much independence as possible.	I want to improve my French as much as possible so that I can continue the tradition of the study of French language and culture in my family. Additionally, the immersive experience has always appealed to me (I went to the Middlebury-Monterey Language Academy with Julia Clemens, another VWPP student this fall). I believe that living in another country, even if it is only for a short period of time, will change the scope of my worldview and hopefully help me understand a plethora of different cultures from a new standpoint.	I'm an English and French major. I am a big reader and will read pretty much anything I can get my hands on. I also enjoy and have taken a few classes in art history.	I do a lot of yoga and I am also one of the editors of the school newspaper. I also work with students at two local schools every week. I love to meet new people and try new things, so I'm pretty open to any new experiences.	No	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	No		While I am not a vegetarian, I would rather not be placed in a household that consumes a lot of meat, as the only meat I really eat is chicken.	Yes	Nope!	I have two principal concerns (sorry, I know you only asked for one). My first and most important concern is centrality. If possible, I would love to live in a place that wouldn't force me to commute a long distance to get to class. My second concern is living near my friends. Two of my good friends are going on the trip--Julia Clemens and Hannah Ryan--and I would love to live close to one of them. I completely understand if this isn't possible! I'm so thrilled to live in Paris I'm sure I'll have a great time anywhere.			I absolutely love children and animals, so I would enjoy living with a family that had either or both of them, although that is not a priority. I am very neat and do not need to be asked to clean up after myself. I usually sleep from 1 or 2 am to the late morning, although I am pretty quiet, so I wouldn't keep anyone up at night. I usually study outside or in the library, not in my room. If I do end up in a homestay, the ideal family for me would probably be a single person or couple who would give me as much freedom as possible and would treat me like an adult.
Muller	Kristina	Yes	Yes		My only foreign travel experience has been to Scotland for one week.	In high school we hosted four international students at my house, each for a few days. One was from France, one from Sweden, one from Brazil, and one from Ghana. I enjoyed getting to learn about their different cultural experiences, but they were not staying with us for long, and so this does not influence my housing preferences.	I live my mom, dad, and two sisters. My mother is 53 years old and is an accountant. My father is 57 years old and is business owner. My older sister is 20 years old and is a student at Hamilton College. My younger sister is 16 years old and is a high school student.	No	No	No		I wish to work toward fluency in French and experience a culture which I am not fully familiar with. I have not done much international traveling and would like to learn more about different parts of the world.	In addition to being a French major, I am interested mainly in women's studies and film studies. Additionally, I am somewhat interested in psychology, history, literature, and music.	I enjoy reading, watching films, and listening to music in my free time. For extra-curricular activities, here at Vassar I volunteer to work with elementary school students.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None	None		No	My principal concern is dietary. I am willing to try new things, but I am slightly concerned that I will offend my host family by not liking things that they serve.			I am okay with living with children as well as animals, although I am uncomfortable around certain dogs. I am a relatively neat/organized person. I prefer to study in my room, and to study in a quiet atmosphere. I am usually up by 9a.m. and in bed by midnight.
Plover	Carrie	Yes	Yes		I've been lucky enough to have had the opportunity to travel quite extensively. With family, I've visited South America, Asia, Africa, and Europe. Within Europe, I've enjoyed visiting France twice -- once on a family vacation, and once in 10th grade on a 10-day language immersion program. I've never had the opportunity to live in another country, however, which is why I so look forward to participating in the Vassar-Wesleyan Paris Program.	I have never had a home stay experience with a foreign family, but my family has hosted an international student in a sense; when I was in tenth grade, we had a German au pair who took classes at our local community college. While I enjoyed this experience, and it impressed upon me notions of cultural sensitivity that I am grateful to have learned, it does not majorly influence my current housing preferences in Paris. Perhaps it would be a positive experience to stay with a family who has children my age or slightly older with whom I could connect, but that would not at all be a requirement.	I have two much older brothers, one of whom is 31 -- and married with a child -- and the other of whom is 27. I'm friendly with both and very close to one, but also lived with them for a relatively short period of my life; by 6th grade, I was the only child in my household. I lived with both parents until I was 14, when my dad passed away. After that I lived alone with my mother, though for a period of a year, we had a German au pair. I'm close with my mother, who is a doctor. She works long hours, so I'm used to taking care of myself and the house, sometimes for extended periods (e.g. a week-long).	No	No	No	I'm not quite clear on what VWPP defines as an 'independent living situation.' I've stayed alone in my own home for extended periods, and lived at Vassar and Middlebury College both by myself and with a roommate, but that's it.	I've studied French since 6th grade and been quite the Francophile since, so I'm very much looking forward to throwing myself into the culture of Paris -- from enjoying restaurants, museums, and cinema to exploring public transit. I also hope to achieve near-fluency while abroad, so I look forward to learning French in an immersive environment, and picking up both academic vocabulary and slang. Finally, I hope to one day work in France, so think living in Paris will be helpful for building social, academic, and professional connections to draw upon in the future.	I'm an International Studies major, and primarily interested in the humanities. I love English and French literature, history, and sociology. I also very much enjoy studying foreign language, and hope to pick up Spanish one day in addition to French.	At school, I'm a member of the Vassar Haiti Project and work for our school's Office of Residential Life. In general, I love cinema (especially French), music, reading, and writing. I'm also intrigued by current events, and tend to be fairly politically active.	Occasional smoker	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	No	No	Nuts; specifically walnuts.	I'm generally not a picky eater. I have also been a vegetarian (or technically a pescatarian -- I eat fish) since my senior year of high school, but I marked below that I won't strictly adhere to these dietary habits in France. I would consider eating meat again because I have the impression that vegetarianism is relatively rare abroad, and I would want to be culturally sensitive to those around me. If placement with a family comfortable providing vegetarian options, or as the Housing Information site mentioned, additional legume/cheese/dairy based options, I would be interested.	No	I am allergic to cats, and have an aforementioned food allergy to most nuts.	I'm generally flexible about housing. Since I've never lived with a host family before, I'm a little bit worried about adapting to my family's living style and making sure that I'm both respectful and culturally sensitive. I hope I live with a relatively laid back family with whom I can be very communicative about such matters to ease any confusion or tension, and that the language barrier isn't a major issue. I also tend to be somewhat introverted, so I hope I'll be able to achieve a good balance between getting to know my host family/enjoying valuable opportunities to practice French, and having solitary time to study and relax within the home.			- I don't have a strong preference about children.  - - While I'm allergic to cats, I very much enjoy the company of animals. I've had a dog since early childhood who I adore.  - - In terms of my interests, I enjoy literature, politics, current events, and music.  - - I'm fairly neat -- I clean my dorm at Vassar about once or twice a week, and enjoy having organized work spaces.  - - I study fairly frequently, and as I mentioned, enjoy having an organized space to do so. I also tend to get distracted easily, and need a quiet place to work. - - I'm used to living in a fairly subdued household, noise-wise. - - I'm a night owl; I often start working relatively late at night, and enjoy sleeping in when possible. I'm also a very deep sleeper; it takes a lot to wake me.
Ryan	Hannah				I have visited France only once, for five days in the summer of 2009.  I have lived in foreign countries for summer programs.  I was at Oxford University for one month in the summer of 2009, and in Florence, Italy for one month in the summer of 2010.	I have never had a home stay experience, but for around four years when I was in middle and high school my family rented out a room in our apartment on Air BnB. We had boarders from Denmark, China, Paris and Texas. I have learned from these experiences what is a good balance of friendly interaction, and what can be intrusive.	I live alone with my mother. My parents separated when I was two or three and growing up I split the time between my mom's house, where I've lived since I was born, and my dad's house.  My dad has since gotten married and moved farther away, six years ago, and I primarily live with my mother now. My mom, who is turning 60 this summer, is a television executive.  My dad, 58, is a housing director for a non-profit company.  My stepmom, 51, is a podiatrist. -  - I'm used to being home alone often, and I have three cats to keep me company. My mom and I both cook on occasion, but neither of us is very good. I am a very very clean and tidy person, as are both of my parents.	No	No	No		To become fluent in the language and culture of the city.	I am a Film Studies and French major, looking to go into Television Programming after graduation.	At Wesleyan I am very involved with the college radio station, WESU.  In addition to being a radio DJ and member of the board of directors, I enjoy participating in student dance shows.  Before coming to college I was a competitive figure skater, on a synchronized skating team.  I hope to continue this activity while in Paris!  I also would like to take art classes while abroad.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None.	I love meat of all kinds!  A family of strict vegetarians would not be a good match.	Yes	No allergies of any sort.	My top two requests are (1) a house in an interesting neighborhood -- reasonable commute, if not totally central, and I quartier in which I can find plenty to enjoy and explore, and (2) cats.  Not absolutely essential, but it would be a big big plus to be in a house with cats!  I am not interested in dogs, unless the cats outnumber them.			I would LOVE a house with cats.  I don't have any preference in terms of children; I would be completely fine with a single woman or older couple, especially if that means a shorter commute.  I, personally, am very neat, but I do not hold others to the same standard as long as the house is reasonably clean, and my own space can be as neat as I like it.  I often stay up late but I am a sound sleeper and noise or light do not bother me, and when I am up late I am not loud.
Shell	Lily	Yes	Yes		No, I have not.	No, I have not.	I am an only child.  My dad is a contractor and artist, and my mom is an artist; I've had a dog since I was 10.  My parents separated when I was 17, but they live close to each other and get along well.	No	No	No	n/a	I love the French language, but I only began studying it at Vassar, and there is no better way to improve my French than to live in Paris.  I am from New York City, so I am very comfortable in a busy city environment, but I am very interested in the differences between Paris and New York.  I have a deep admiration for French art and literature (and food!), and I cannot wait to live in such a culturally rich and distinct city in a different country.	I am interested in literature and history, particularly in areas of race/ethnic studies and issues of food and agriculture.	I am very interested in theater, and I love going to plays; I am particularly interested in costume design, and I work in the costume shop here at Vassar as well as designing multiple student theater productions.  I am also very interested in farming and gardening, and I love to cook.  I go to the gym and occasionally play tennis, and I enjoy hiking.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	red food coloring	n/a	No	No.	My principal concern/priority is getting along well with my hosts.  Though I would be interested in living with a small family (as opposed to a single woman, etc), and I like young children, I would prefer not to live with a large family, because having a little bit of time and space to myself during the day is important.  In addition, though I am confident about my ability to use public transportation, my other biggest concern is being in a safe neighborhood in which I can feel comfortable alone at night.			I don't mind children, just as long as it's not a large family, and I don't mind pets at all.  I'm not instinctively neat, but I do enjoy cleaning (would be happy to take on chores) and will definitely keep my area clean.  I often play music or listen to public radio while I clean or do laundry, but it doesn't need to be loud at all!  I tend to stay up late (between 12 and 2) watching TV or doing homework, and sleep pretty late (between 10 and 11), and I need it to be quiet and dark to sleep.
Tannenbaum	Gabrielle	Yes	Yes		I've been to France for a week or so with my mother as a child (and also Martinique) but otherwise, no.	I've never had a home stay experience or hosted an international student.	I live with my mother (my parents are divorced and I have no contact with my father) and my younger brother (he's 6 years younger than I am, and has a different father, from whom my mother is separated). My mother is a lawyer, and she works from home. We have 6 acres, on which we have 2 horses, dogs, cats, and at one point a chicken, so I'm used to animals of most sorts, as well as having plenty of room. My mother and I are very close, because for so long it was just the two of us living together, more like sisters than anything else. I'm used to helping out with chores and working a job as well as school, since my family is relatively low-income and my mom is a single parent.	No	Yes	Yes	I've had a roommate before (at college) and frequently make dinners for my family and cook for myself, so I"m able to be independent but have never lived in this situation before.	I've always wanted to study abroad in Paris, since my mother did so when she was in college, and French was my grandfather's first language. I've taken French my whole life and want to be able to become fully fluent in the language, as well as to study and live in Paris and enjoy the culture.	Drama (writing and acting), Political Science (of all kinds), English (writing and reading), French and Spanish (I speak both)	reading (I almost always have a book in hand), listening to music, singing (I am also almost always singing or humming, especially when doing the dishes or other chores, so I'd love if this wasn't a problem for my host family. I can obviously curtail myself, and keep it down or sing at reasonable hours but I need to be able to sing at least a little in my home), playing guitar (again, I can limit this but would love to be able to do so at least a little bit)	No	No	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	No	No	None	I'm a vegetarian, but eat fish, eggs, and dairy, as well as honey. My brother and mom are not vegetarians, so a family that eats meat is not a problem for me (and I know how to cook most things, even most types of meat, since I cook for my own family frequently), as long as there are some other options for me to have.	Yes	No	I'm most worried about being in a friendly environment - I would love not to be a nuisance to my host family, and to have them enjoy my stay. I would just like to be comfortable in the situation I'm in. I'm adaptable, and hope they will be as well. My biggest issue areas are probably that I sing quite a bit and am generally reading while walking around, and would hate for them to interpret that as me not wanting to be sociable and thus creating an uncomfortable situation. My other concern would be being able to have my own space to retreat to for awhile, which may be difficult in an apartment, especially where we're all sharing a smaller space and bathroom. I also am much more comfortable living with women than with men, because I've lived with my mom for my whole life, and never really with a man around.			Something that's particular to myself is that in general I need 12 hours of sleep every night. I can make do with 10 hours or sometimes 8 or 9, but I need to catch up on sleep if I do that for too long. It's odd for a college student, I know, but I'll need to be able to get plenty of sleep (which I can do in most situations), but my host family would have to understand that. I like animals, and most children, and speak Spanish about as well as I speak French, if that helps the family I"m with at all. I prefer things to be clean even if they're not neat, and while I don't need things to be spotless, I do begin to get bothered by mess every week or so and do a deep clean of all my own things then. I study generally during the day, and can do so with noise and music happening (if I need absolute quiet I can find a library or somewhere else to go). My sleeping habits are probably what I"m most uncompromising about, but that should only affect myself really.  The last thing that I can say that makes me difficult is that, because I'm a singer, I'm very protective of my voice and get very nervous about getting colds or other illnesses. It's obviously unavoidable, but I just think it's only fair to add that I get very paranoid about sicknesses and germs because of that.
Wang	Zijun	No	Yes		To begin with, I am an international student from China studying in the US, thus for me, this is already an experience living outside of my country. Prior to studying at Vassar, I spent a year in Michigan in my junior year of high school and lived with a host family there. Though I have not traveled to France yet, I have had plenty of experiences traveling/living/being on exchange programs with others and alone to the following countries: US, UK,  Japan, Norway, Czech, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Mexico. I have been living in the US for 2.5 years; prior to this, I lived in Leeds, UK for a half a year with my parents when I was six.	When I was sixteen, I came to the US for the first time and stayed with a host family in Wixom, Michigan. Before my arrival, they had only intended to temporarily host me for one month, but after being on very good terms, I stayed in their house for the entire program and we are still keeping in touch. I visited them again when I came back for college, and they are visiting me in April 2014 at Vassar. From that experience I have learned to, first of all, be very grateful towards the family opening their doors to you. Secondly, it takes a lot of efforts to maintain a good relationship: to be a good communicator, a good daughter to their household, and a clean guest. My family in Michigan was a couple in their 50s and 60s with no kids. They had two cats as pets. I felt that it especially took me a lot of efforts with them because they were older than my parents by a decade and more. If possible, I would like a family with about the same age group as my parents (in their 50s). I would prefer a couple to a single parent.	I am the only child of my family. My parents are in their late 40s and early 50s. My mother is a biology teacher for 7th and 8th grade, and my dad is a manager in the State Electricity company. My parents are compassionate, supportive, and intelligent. They give me advises on things but never make decisions for me. They worry about me from time to time, but they never fail to be supportive towards my inspirations. Therefore I am eternally grateful for the educational and familial background they have given me and all the sacrifices they have made for me.	No	No	No	N/A	I think Paris is great for exploration and growth. I'd like to think of myself as a city person: cultural events, museums, and even just city lights never fail to amaze and inspire me. Being one of the great cities, of course, Paris becomes one of the destinations on my checklist. Then, as Hemingway has said, Paris is a moveable feast. Living in Paris will be different from being a tourist in Paris. I am extremely excited at every thought of me living in this great city and taking in all the cultural highlights of Paris and France. I think it will be a privilege for me to be able to live in another culture in my 20s, and mold the characteristics of a great city into my own disposition.	Academically I am interested in the intersection of different cultures. Being from China and also a double major in French and English, I hope to explore how different cultures come together in this post-modern world, especially from a standpoint of literature. I want to learn as many languages as possible when I'm young, live in different places, and possibly continue my graduate school studies in comparative literature.	I like visiting art museums, galleries, theaters, boutique stores, and book stores. I enjoy going to local cafes and reading. I am also interested in exploring different places on foot, which is another reason why I think Paris will be a great fit for me. In college I am also involved in extracurriculars including acting, theatre making, editing for newsletters, and equestrian.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Mango	N/A	Yes	No.	I hope that I could have as many interaction with my host as possible: it will be a great way for me to connect and also practice my spoken French. If possible, I would also want someone who might have some of the similar interests as I have. I would love to assist the host with daily chores within and out of the house. With meals not included in the meal plan, I would also like to cook sometimes, so I would appreciate the access to the kitchen in the house. In all, I would love to have someone open to communications, warm and welcoming, and respectful of my privacy.			I am an early sleeper, and my usual sleeping habit in college is from midnight to eight in the morning. In the weekends I would like to go out on some nights, but I will make it back to the house in reasonable hours. I am generally clean and neat. I keep myself organized and I abide to my daily schedule. It will be very nice to have children or teens in the house. I don't deal too well with noise, so maybe infants in the house will not be my preference. I do not mind pets, and if possible, I would love to have dogs.
Yung	Winnie	Yes	Yes		I traveled through Europe with a tour group when I was ten. We visited France, Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, and England. However, I don't remember much because the duration of the trip was only ten days. I have also been to Hong Kong and mainland China, although the last time I traveled there was when I was twelve. I would stay for usually two months.	No.	I have two sisters, who are both much older than I, and a younger brother, who is four years younger. My brother lives at home with my mother still. My father passed away when I was thirteen.	Yes	Yes	Yes	I enjoy cooking so I'd like a space where I feel comfortable doing so.	I've always dreamed of living in Paris. I just want a larger and less egocentric perspective of the world, so I can eventually create my own culture. Paris is such a unique city and so rich with history. I don't know when else in my life I'd be able to experience Paris like a Parisian.	Creative writing and neuroscience	Writing, reading, watching reality television and analyzing it (light anthropological research), playing piano, cooking, baking desserts, fashion. -  - Music is a major one. I would love to live with somebody with great music taste. My favorite artists are The Beatles, Pixies, Nirvana, Pavement, Pink Floyd, My Bloody Valentine, Portishead, Nujabes, TOKiMONSTA, and Led Zeppelin. I also enjoy stuff from Motown, some rockabilly, Kate Bush, Tupac, Shlohmo, Aaliyah, the Meat Puppets, Buddy Holly, Carole King, and The Doors	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None	None, except that I don't wear shoes in the house.	No	No	I'm worried about living with somebody very culturally insensitive because I would not feel safe there. I really would prefer not to deal with people who are going to make racist jokes at my expense. Safety is my priority. I want to be able to walk around where I live at night without feeling threatened as an Asian-American woman.			I do have a tendency to stay up late. I am fairly and quiet, though I do play music in my room (but not too loudly). I'd prefer not to be somewhere too loud nor somewhere too quiet. I am a neat person, but not overzealous about it. Living with a dog would be nice, but it's not something I'm insisting on. Overall, I'd like to live somewhere cozy, yet still slightly urban.
Zisman	Olivia	Yes	Yes		I have traveled to Paris and the Southwest of France with my family for one or two weeks. I also spent a week in Paris with two of my friends two summers ago. I did an immersion program in Nice for a month during the summer of 2009.	In high school I went to Quebec with my french class and stayed with a host family for a few days. Another student in my french class and I stayed together with a mother and her daughter who was a few years older than us. The friend I stayed with was not as comfortable speaking french as I was, so I did most of the communicating, which was a little stressful. The family was not very welcoming at first which also made it difficult and makes me hope to have a host with whom I can connect well while in Paris.	I live with my mother, father, and little sister. My sister is four years younger than me and we get along really well. My father was a lawyer and worked for the city of Yonkers-where we live-as the inspector general for many years. He is now a professor at John Jay College in New York City. My mother is an elementary school art teacher at Fieldston Lower, where my sister and I both went to school.	No	No	No	While I have never lived on my own, I have experience cooking for myself at home and during summer programs. I am a pretty independent person and enjoy having time to myself so I am excited to live in a more independent living situation while in Paris. Although I am good at being on my own, I do hope to have a host family I can connect well with so that I can learn from them and also feel comfortable and welcomed in my living space, which is really important to me.	I have been studying French since Middle School and can't wait to get to fully experience the culture and language I have been learning for years. While I have studied French in school for a long time, I still don't feel completely comfortable in my speaking ability, so I really hope living in France and speaking the language every day will increase my confidence level and allow me to get closer to fluency. I am really excited to live on my own in a new place outside of my comfort zone. Additionally, as an art history major, I am drawn to Paris for its central role in the Western art historical tradition. I am so excited to get to visit all the incredible museums in Paris and to explore the art this new city has to offer.	I am an art history major at Vassar, and am mainly interested in modern art. I also plan on minoring in French, and am interested in studio art as well as English and sociology.	I love making art--particularly drawing, sculpture, and collage. I work as a student docent at the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center (Vassar's on campus art museum), and teach an after school art class at the Middle School in Poughkeepsie every week. This semester I have also started working on the Vassar Farm. I love being active and going on walks, hikes, or bike rides to explore new places, but also really enjoy watching movies and reading in cafes. I also do modern dance and would hope to take some kind of dance class while in Paris.	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	No			Yes	No.	I really hope to be able to connect well with my host family so that I feel comfortable in my living space and not like an imposition or a stranger. I am more reserved and do well in smaller group settings, but really love making connections with people and hope to be able to find a good balance between being on my own and feeling like I have my own space while also getting to know my host family so that I can fully learn about French culture from them. I am really good at adapting to other people's living situations but also hope that I will be able to contribute something to the environment so that my host and I can have an easy-going, comfortable relationship and that I can feel supported and comfortable in their space. I feel most comfortable with relaxed, easy-going people, and would hope to form this type of relationship with my host.			I am really good with children and animals, and would be fine being placed in a family with young children. However, I think I would also do well living with an older couple or woman. I would hope to live with someone with some of my similar interests so that we could connect on that basic level. I like to keep my own space relatively neat, and am pretty relaxed about my study and sleeping habits, so as long as I feel like I have my own space to comfortably work and live in I will be okay.
